## **Acquaintance Path Process (APP) Overview**

**APP Definition:**
The Acquaintance Path Process (APP) is a systematic approach designed to facilitate the progression of initial contacts into deeper, meaningful connections. It is typically employed in contexts such as online dating or social networking, where initial interactions are virtual. The APP leverages a series of predefined conversational formats (FMTs) to ensure interactions are engaging, appropriate, and effective in building rapport and trust.

**Structured Table of APP Formats**

**FMT Name**	**Purpose**	**Example Usage**
**ICEBREAKER FMT**	To initiate contact and grab attention.	“Noticed your passion for photography. Got any tips?”
**ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FMT**	To thank for a response and encourage interaction.	“Thanks for sharing that, it’s fascinating! Tell me more.”
**BARRIERS FMT**	To address and ease potential communication barriers.	“I see you’re from Italy. I love Italian culture!”
**FILTER FMT (Deep Conversations)**	To gather key information subtly.	“What’s an experience that has shaped who you are?”
**REVIEW REPORT FMT**	To analyze information for tailored communication.	“Reviewing our chat, I see a shared love for jazz.”
**PULLOUT FMT**	To transition the chat to a private platform.	“I’ve enjoyed our chat. Mind if we switch to WhatsApp?”

### **How to Use the APP Formats**

1.	**Start with ICEBREAKER FMT**: Kick off the conversation with a message that resonates with something specific in the recipient’s profile or interests to capture their attention.

2.	**Engage with ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FMT**: Once they respond, use this format to express gratitude for their reply and keep the conversation flowing.

3.	**Apply BARRIERS FMT if needed**: If you notice any cultural or language differences, address these early on to show openness and adaptability, which can enhance comfort and connectivity.

4.	**Deepen engagement with FILTER FMT**: This format is crucial for understanding the recipient’s personality, lifestyle, and preferences through deeper conversations.
	
5.	**Evaluate interactions with REVIEW REPORT FMT**: Summarize insights and adjust your communication strategy based on the interaction patterns and interests you’ve identified.
	
6.	**Transition with PULLOUT FMT**: If the interactions are positive and both parties seem comfortable, suggest moving the conversation to a more private and convenient communication platform.
