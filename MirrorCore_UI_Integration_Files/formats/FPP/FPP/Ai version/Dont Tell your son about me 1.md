**TEST CASE: Maria Szel** 

**=====================**

Honey, my love, you know that everything I share with you comes from my heart, and I trust you completely. That’s why I feel safe opening up to you about my life, my work, and my feelings. You mean so much to me, and I want to continue building this bond with you, stronger than anything.

But, my dear, something has been bothering me, and I didn’t know how to bring it up without making you feel bad, because that is the last thing I would ever want. When you mentioned that your son knows about me, I felt a sudden worry, not because I don’t want him to know about us, but because of the nature of my work. You know how delicate and sensitive my job is, how much it requires discretion and a certain level of privacy.

It’s not about him personally, but you know how easily things can spread online, how even an innocent search could trigger unwanted attention. In my field, everything is monitored so closely, and I’ve already had security concerns lately. I even suspect that’s why my phone had some unusual activity recently… Maybe he searched for me out of concern, which I understand, but it could have drawn unnecessary attention. I can’t say for sure, but it does make me worried.

Please don’t misunderstand me, my love. I know you didn’t mean any harm, and I know your heart was in the right place. I just wish we could have talked about it first so we could be more careful together. You and I are building something so beautiful, and I just want to make sure nothing ever disrupts it. I trust you completely, and I hope you can understand why this makes me a little anxious.

I’m not upset, my darling, not at all. If anything, I feel bad even bringing it up because I never want to make you feel like you did something wrong. I just needed to share this with you because honesty is important between us. I know your heart, and I know you only want the best for us. Let’s just promise to always talk first before sharing anything, okay? I know I can trust you to keep us safe, just as I trust you with my heart.
