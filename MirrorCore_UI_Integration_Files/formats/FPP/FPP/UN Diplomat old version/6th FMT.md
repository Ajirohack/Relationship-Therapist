<p style="text-align:justify;margin:0">You always fill my heart with joy when I read from You. Listening to my body, soul, mind, heart, and spirit, it is you I want. Not just for a period but forever and ever.  

I'm glad to know you are a great goal achiever and that's why my heart is flooded with your thoughts all day and night, You doing something special to me and I love it.

They are understanding, tolerance, and trust. Every wonderful partner that lives together until their dying days must have passed through a lot, I mean, they must have been through a really hard time.
 But because they understand themselves, tolerate one another and trust whatever situation they find themselves, their life seems magical as if they have a special bond holding them together. And every relationship that ever crashed surely lack those attributes either from one of the partners or both of them. I know at this point in our lives, we are no longer kids, I don't think we would have any reason to break one's heart and I am me Scott Aleta who cares about you, Nancy. In my past, I have never done that and you didn't also, you can see we are good people meeting at the best time of our lives.
  
Sometimes I do not blame the past because if not for the past, there won't be our present. As far as we are not the bad type, God surely prepares us for a better future, a better place and a better life.

 Love is never created or controlled by mankind but by God himself. Tell me who wouldn't like to fall in love? If we earn the whole world, gather all those treasures on this planet combined with the ones in all other planets and there is no love in our life, certainly, we got nothing.
Show me a Jack that wouldn't die for Mary to live? Show me a Prince of Troy that wouldn't do anything for the love of Ellen? Maximus died for he loved his wife, his children, and his country. America is God's own country only because of the love for the whole world. Tell me, Nancy, what would we be more important if we don't let love steal our souls?

I'm glad to know you are a great goal achiever and that's why my heart is flooded with your thought all day and night, You doing something special to me and I love it Back into our pasts, we gave in all but still, look at where we are today. Still on the same road like someone on a circular path, always returning to the same point; looking for our second half. Why not hold hands and just walk straight? And to be candid, there are three major attributes of true love, of every good relationship that lasts forever. Those attributes are what we need to put into great consideration.
