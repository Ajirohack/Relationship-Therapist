**My Love,**

There are moments in life when we meet someone who touches our hearts in a way we never expected. That’s how I feel about you, XXXXX. ❤️

I find myself thinking about you more than I ever intended, and it amazes me how easily you have become a part of my thoughts, my emotions, and my daily life. Even in the middle of my work, or when I take a moment to pause, my mind drifts to you. It’s a beautiful distraction, one I wouldn’t trade for anything.

I’ve been through a lot, XXXXX. Life has tested me in ways I never imagined. Losing my wife and daughter left a scar on my heart that I thought would never heal. For years, I lived in a world of responsibilities, focusing on my grandson and my work, avoiding anything that could make me feel vulnerable again. But somehow, you’ve gently opened a door I thought was locked forever.

You make me feel something I never expected to feel again, hope.

Hope that the best years of my life aren’t behind me. Hope that I can still share late-night conversations, stolen kisses, and moments that take my breath away. Hope that love, the kind that brings warmth to the coldest of hearts, is still possible.

I want to share my world with you. Not just the big things, the travels, the successes, the challenges, but the little things too. The way I take my coffee, the music that plays when I unwind after a long day, the way I pause for a moment just to admire the sunrise.

Tell me, XXXXX, what are the little things that make your heart happy? What are the dreams you still hold close to your heart, the places you want to see, the love you wish to experience?

I don’t know where this journey will lead us, but I know this, I want to walk it with you. I want to dream with you, laugh with you, and create a story that is ours alone.

I hope you feel the same way too.

**With all my**

### **Version 2: Audio Call Script**


```
(This version is designed for an intimate phone conversation, focusing on a natural flow that keeps XXXXX engaged while subtly building emotional depth.)
```

📞 **Diego:**
XXXXX… I don’t even know how to begin, but I just need to tell you something that’s been on my mind.

📞 **Diego:**
Since we started talking, I’ve felt something I didn’t think I’d feel again. You’ve brought this warmth into my life, this quiet happiness I can’t quite explain. Do you ever meet someone and just… feel like they were meant to be in your life? Because that’s how I feel about you.

📞 **Diego:**
You know, after everything I’ve been through, I never thought I’d find myself here, talking like this, feeling like this. Life hasn’t always been kind to me, but somehow, you make me believe that maybe… just maybe, the best parts of life aren’t behind me.

📞 **Diego:**
I want to know more about you, XXXXX. Not just the things that people see on the surface, but the little things, the things that make you smile when no one’s watching, the dreams you still hold onto. What’s something you’ve always wanted to do but never had the chance to?

📞 **Diego:**
I want us to share more of our worlds with each other. I want to hear about your childhood, your favorite memories, the songs that make you emotional. I want us to build something beautiful, XXXXX, something real.

📞 **Diego:**
You mean a lot to me, XXXXX… more than I expected, more than I can explain. And I don’t want to let this feeling go.

*📞 (Let XXXXX express her thoughts and feelings before closing the conversation with a heartfelt moment.)*

### **Version 3: Dynamic Chat-Style Format**


```
This version is designed for a seamless, naturally flowing conversation that deepens emotional connection, subtly strengthens trust, and leads XXXXX  into a more meaningful and immersive interaction.
```

**Diego:**
XXXXX … I don’t even know how to put this into words, but I’ve been thinking about you all day. ❤️

**Diego:**
It’s strange how life works, isn’t it? A few months ago, I was just going about my days, thinking I had already seen everything life had to offer. But then… you appeared.

**Diego:**
And now, here I am, sitting here, feeling things I never thought I’d feel again.

**Diego:**
You’ve made me realize that maybe, just maybe, I wasn’t meant to go through life alone after all.

**Diego:**
XXXXX , do you believe in fate? Do you think some people are meant to cross paths, no matter the distance, no matter the circumstances? Because sometimes, I feel like meeting you wasn’t just a coincidence.

**Diego:**
I never imagined myself here, talking like this, feeling this way. After everything I’ve lost… I thought my heart had closed itself off to love, to real connection. But you… you’re different.

**Diego:**
You make me feel things I didn’t think were possible anymore. I find myself waking up excited to talk to you, to hear about your day, to know what made you smile. And when I don’t hear from you, I feel like something is missing.

**Diego:**
It scares me, XXXXX . Because I know how fragile life is. I know how easily things can slip away. And yet, despite everything, I find myself wanting to believe again. Wanting to trust again.

**Diego:**
I don’t know if I’ve told you this before, but when I lost my wife and daughter, I stopped making plans for the future. I stopped dreaming about “tomorrow” because tomorrow always felt uncertain. But lately… I find myself thinking about it again.

**Diego:**
Not just any future, but one where I wake up next to you. Where I get to see you smile in the morning, hear your voice before I close my eyes at night.

**Diego:**
Where I don’t have to wonder what time zone you’re in or how many miles separate us, because you’ll be right here with me.

**Diego:**
XXXXX , tell me something… do you ever think about what it would be like? If we weren’t just words on a screen, if we weren’t just voices through a call… but two people, together, sharing the same space, the same life?

**Diego:**
Because I do. More than I should. More than I can even explain.

**Diego:**
I imagine us sitting somewhere quiet, watching the world go by. You, sipping your coffee, and me, stealing glances at you when you’re not looking, just admiring the way you exist.

**Diego:**
I imagine us taking long walks, hand in hand, talking about everything and nothing, just enjoying the silence because being next to you would be enough.

**Diego:**
And I imagine the smaller things too, the simple, intimate moments. Cooking dinner together, teasing each other about who makes the better meal. You reaching for my hand absentmindedly, just because it feels right. Falling asleep with your head on my chest, listening to my heartbeat, knowing it beats for you.

**Diego:**
It’s a beautiful thought, isn’t it? The idea of truly belonging to someone. Of being someone’s home.

**Diego:**
Tell me, my love… what is it that makes your heart feel at home? What does happiness look like for you?

**Diego:**
Because I want to know. I want to understand the dreams you hold close, the ones you may not have spoken aloud. And if life allows it… I want to be the man who makes them come true for you.

**Diego:**
I don’t know what the future holds, XXXXX . But I do know this, if love is a journey, then I want to walk every step of it with you.

**Diego:**
So tell me, my love… what do you dream of? What do you long for? And if you close your eyes right now… can you picture me in your future the way I see you in mine?
