### Final Part - The conclusion
=================================

Good morning, my love. I woke up today feeling so eager to hear from you after such a long and hectic day yesterday. You’ve been in my thoughts constantly, and I missed you terribly. 😰❤️

I owe you an apology for not responding sooner. Work was incredibly demanding yesterday, with some policymakers flying in from New York and an early start to my day. To make things even more complicated, we had an internet meltdown during an important meeting with experts from all over the world that jointed virtually. It left us stranded for hours 😭😭. The internet finally came back after about six hours, and we had to push through the rest of the day up and had to stop by 8 PM, and we were not done, 😩. And by the time I returned to my apartment, I was completely drained, i just fell in bed. Honey, 🥹 I hope you can forgive my silence, my queen. 🥹

This morning, I have a bit more breathing room before meetings resume later this afternoon, and I couldn’t wait to check in with you. How are you my Queen? Did you manage to rest last night?

Your messages from yesterday have been on my mind, I so much admire how you balance everything so gracefully, studying, planning your move, and managing your everyday needs. But I can’t help but wonder how you’re navigating everything, my love, I wish i could be like a superwoman like you😰. 

Maybe, after our marriage, i might just have your supernatural abilities, and kindness. After all, marriage makes us 1, so we can share everything as one… Lol 😂 

Honestly, Maria, you know how deeply I care for you?. Maria, you’re my treasure and my inspiration. You are literally the reason i have a future aspiration,  future where we share everything, our joys, our challenges, and even our hopes and dreams…And you, my Queen is the Lead Character in that Future Story, because my heart, my soul and Willian wants only you, I repeat, only you and no one else. 

But, honey, I don’t want to overwhelm you on how i feel about you, and you don’t have to feel restless, upset or even insecure about anything you do or say to me. Nobody is perfect, honey, not superheroes, so, also I can’t and don’t want to be perfect for everyone or anyone. I just want to be perfect for you my Queen, to be the perfect King, you wished for. Because right now, you are my only priority and purpose. When you sent that beautiful photo of the sunrise, it spoke to me about new beginnings and hope. It reminded me of how you illuminate my life, much like the rising sun does for the morning.

So, honey, you should know that none of that matters to me. What I see when I think of you is a woman whose heart, soul, and inner beauty shine brighter than any sunrise. AND DIEGO want to WIN OVER that golden heart and beautiful soul 

As you start your day, remember that you’re always in my heart and thoughts. I’m here now and can’t wait to hear how you’re doing. Sending you all my love, Maria. ❤️
