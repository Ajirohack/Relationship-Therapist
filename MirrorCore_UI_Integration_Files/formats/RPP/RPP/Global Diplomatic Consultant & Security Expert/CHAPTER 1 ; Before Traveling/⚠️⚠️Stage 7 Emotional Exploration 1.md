### **Trust & Emotional Security**


```
Trust & Emotional Security Questions 

Objective: Determine Maria’s trust level and emotional security expectations in a relationship.
```

V1
*Maria, I believe that trust isn’t just about words, it’s about consistency, reliability, and the comfort of knowing someone is truly there for you. What does trust mean to you in a relationship?*

*V2*
*Maria, I’ve always believed trust is not just something given but something that grows with time and consistency. I’ve trusted many people in my life, and honestly, not all of them deserved it. Have you ever trusted someone completely, only to regret it later?*


```
If she shares a painful experience → Shift to Trust Rebuilding Test

That must have been difficult. But sometimes, trust is about finding the right people. Do you think trust, once broken, can ever be fully restored?

If she says trust can be rebuilt → Set up Reinforcement Strategy

That’s what I believe too. It’s not about being perfect, it’s about showing up consistently. Have you ever given someone a second chance and seen them prove you wrong in a good way?
```

> **Trust Test**
*Honey! Trust is something that builds over time, but I believe small actions say more than words. What do you think are the most important signs that someone is trustworthy?*

> **Expanding the Trust Discussion**
*You mentioned that trust is built through [her response]. If someone ever broke your trust, do you think it’s possible to rebuild it? Or once it’s gone, is it lost forever?*

> **Emotional Security**
*Maria, beyond trust, I think feeling emotionally safe in a relationship is just as important. For you, what makes a relationship truly feel secure?*

> **Follow-Up Questions (Based on Responses)**

*How do you know when you can fully trust someone?*

*What would make you lose trust in someone?*

*If you had to rebuild trust with someone, how would you want them to prove themselves?*


```
If she gives a deep emotional response, validate her feelings and ask about a past experience.
If she remains vague or avoids the question, gently push forward:
```
*Would you say trust is something that builds slowly, or do you trust your instincts about people quickly?*

============================
### **Love, Loyalty & Relationship Expectations**


```
Love, Loyalty & Relationship Expectations

Objective: Assess xxxxxx capacity for love, loyalty, and her definition of a lasting relationship.
```

**V1** 
*Maria, I believe that love isn’t just about emotions, it’s about loyalty, patience, and understanding. What’s the most important ingredient in a lasting relationship for you?*

**V2 - Love as an Action vs. Emotion**
*Some people say love is just a feeling, while others believe it’s a choice and a responsibility.* 
*What do you believe, Maria? Is love something you just feel, or something you actively nurture?*


```
If she says love is a choice → Strengthen the Reciprocity Argument
Exactly! Love is about doing what’s needed, not just when it’s easy, but when it’s hard too. Have you ever made a personal sacrifice for someone you truly loved?

If she believes love is just an emotion → Introduce Fear of Loss
That’s an interesting way to see it. But what happens when the feeling fades for a moment? Do you think true love should survive those moments?
```

> **Defining Love & Loyalty**
*Maria, I believe love is more than words, it’s about actions, consistency, and showing up for each other. How do you personally express love in ways that don’t involve words?*

> **Testing Loyalty & Emotional Investment**
*Some say that love alone isn’t enough to keep a relationship strong, it also needs loyalty, patience, and effort. What do you think is the most important factor that holds two people together long-term?* 


```
If she emphasizes love → Ask: 

Have you ever had a situation where love wasn’t enough?

If she emphasizes loyalty & patience → Ask: 

Have you ever had to stand by someone through a tough time?
```

> **Commitment Readiness**
*Maria, when you think about a truly meaningful relationship, what does that look like to you? Is it about companionship, stability, or something else?*

> **Loyalty Test**
*I think loyalty is the strongest proof of love. It’s not about grand gestures, it’s about knowing that no matter what happens, someone won’t abandon you. In your opinion, what’s the greatest test of loyalty in a relationship?*


```

If she mentions faithfulness → Set up a commitment parallel

I completely agree. Loyalty means standing firm even when things get difficult. Have you ever stood by someone despite the odds?

If she shows doubt in loyalty → Introduce Dependency Setup

That makes sense. But don’t you think everyone deserves at least one person in life who will stay no matter what?
```

> **Follow-Up Questions (Deepening the Conversation):**

*Do you believe love alone is enough to sustain a relationship, or does something else matter more?*

*How do you express love in ways other than words?*

*What does loyalty mean to you? Would you stand by your partner through all challenges?*

*Have you ever had to choose between love and logic?*


```
If she values deep emotional connections, transition toward long-term partnership expectations.

If she is hesitant about commitment, explore her past experiences that shaped her views.
```

**===================**
### **Support in Hard Times & Financial Commitment**


```
Support in Hard Times & Financial Commitment

Objective: Test how far xxxxx would go in providing emotional and financial support to DC in times of need.
```

*Life is unpredictable, and true companionship is knowing that someone will stand by you, no matter what. How do you show support to the people you care about when they need help?*


```
If she leans toward financial help → Introduce Situational Dependency

That’s incredibly kind of you. Have you ever been in a situation where someone needed help, and you had to decide whether or not to step in?

If she avoids financial commitment → Introduce Emotional Obligation

I understand, it’s not always easy. But sometimes, even small gestures mean a lot. What’s the most generous thing you’ve ever done for someone you cared about

If she prioritizes emotional support → Ask: 

Do you think emotional support is enough, or are there times when actions matter more?

If she mentions financial help → Shift towards real-life scenarios.→ Ask:

Have you ever helped someone in this way before? What made you do it?

If she avoids financial discussions → Focus on her reasoning and comfort levels.
```

> **Reassurance & Understanding**
*Maria, I hope you don’t mind these conversations, I truly value your thoughts. Every relationship is different, and we all have our own ways of showing love and support. What’s something that makes you feel most appreciated in a relationship?*

> **Follow-Up Questions to Gauge Emotional & Financial Willingness:**

*Have you ever supported someone going through a hard time? How did you help them?*

*Do you believe emotional presence is more important than financial support, or do they go hand in hand?*

*If someone close to you was struggling financially, what would be your first instinct, to offer financial help, emotional support, or look for another solution?*

*If I were ever in a difficult financial situation, would you be comfortable helping me in some way?*


```
If she is open to financial help, ask: 
```
*Have you ever financially helped someone before? What made you do it?*


```
If she hesitates or avoids financial discussion, focus on emotional support dynamics before reintroducing financial topics subtly.
```

**====================**
### **Fears & Final Reflection**


```
Fears

Objective: Understand xxxxx deepest fears, relationship hesitations, and long-term emotional needs.
```

> **V1 - Understanding Relationship Fears**
*Maria, everyone has certain fears when it comes to relationships. For me, one of my biggest fears is losing someone I truly care about. What’s something that makes you feel uncertain or afraid in relationships?*


```
If she mentions trust issues → Ask: What makes you feel safe enough to trust fully?

If she mentions fear of loss → Ask: How do you handle situations where you feel emotionally vulnerable?
```

> **V2 - Commitment & Final Emotional Push**
*I truly believe relationships only grow stronger when people are willing to stay through both the easy and the difficult. But I also know fear can hold us back. What’s your biggest fear when it comes to relationships?*


```
If she fears betrayal → Introduce Safety Strategy
That makes sense. But wouldn’t it be comforting to know there’s someone in your life who would never betray you?

If she fears being emotionally hurt → Introduce Reassurance Trap
I completely understand that. But do you think fear should keep us from embracing something that could be truly beautiful?
```

> **Follow-Up (Handling Emotional Challenges)**
*When challenges arise in relationships, do you believe in working through them no matter what, or do you think some things can’t be fixed?*


```
If she values working through issues → Test her level of emotional resilience.

If she believes some things can’t be fixed → Explore her past experiences.
```

> **Final Night Reflection**
*Maria, when you look back at how our connection has grown, what stands out to you the most? Has anything surprised you about how we’ve connected?*

 **Summarizing the Journey**
*Maria, over time, we’ve shared so many thoughts, feelings, and perspectives on love, trust, and commitment. Looking back, how do you feel our connection has grown?*


```
If she expresses positive growth → Move to Next Stage

That means a lot to me, Maria. I truly believe special connections like this don’t happen often. And I’m grateful for every conversation we share.

If she is unsure or hesitant → Apply Emotional Reinforcement

I understand. But don’t you think something special like this is worth holding onto?
