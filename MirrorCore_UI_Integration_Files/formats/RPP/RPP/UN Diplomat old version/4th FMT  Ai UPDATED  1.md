## Intro to Grandson and Love 
**==========================**


I couldn‚Äôt sleep last night, I thought about you all through the night, about the positivity you have brought into my life‚Ä¶ so i wrote something down for you to read while am at work

Since meeting you, i have learnt a lot even though you are unaware of your lessons üòÖ, you have showed care and concern over me, that I haven‚Äôt gotten in years after i lost my family, you are the closest person i can call a family. 

Willian is a young boy who grew up not having a motherly and womanly love, i have been her father and her mother‚Ä¶It‚Äôs was difficult for both of us, but we scaled through. *****, I will understand that you dont want getting involved with my family that‚Äôs me and Willian. You wouldn‚Äôt blame me because when i told him about you, i could literally feel the joy, excitement and happiness when reading his email, i felt so happy that he felt that way, it‚Äôs been long i get to see or feel his happy. Those are the little but important impacts you have brought to my life and Willian‚Äôs.

Willian has been through a lot, losing her mother and grandmother at a young age, I wouldn‚Äôt blame him for the excitement he might felt when i told him about you and his response. Even though he hasn‚Äôt said so yet, but i know he needs that motherly love that life has deprived from him. Well, I hoped and prayed that i get to meet a loving, caring, kindhearted and humble step grandmother who will love and cherish him like her own. I hope you get to share some of these love you showered upon me to Willian too. 

To be honest with you, my day and night  was full of the thought about our life to begin.  you are doing something special to me (lol) I hope I'm doing something special too. I mean after all these years, I would have thought I might not have the possibilities again of having my dream woman, my partner, my best friend, and co-pilot.  
       
I wouldn't be scared anyway, because truly, love is not about finding the right person but creating the right relationship. It's not about how much love you have in the beginning but how much love you build till the end.

The inevitable truth is, if it is meant to be, our hearts will find each other regardless of the distance apart. And if our hearts melt together so will our bodies and souls. Then every word and every touch will fuel our passion flame. I will be yours, you will be mine, and we will be one, forever and ever.  You are a woman who understands a man's dream.

As regards all our conversations, the things we have known about each other, , I make bold to say, 'I love you!' I want you to look at those pictures of ours, do you ever think any other person could match us? My answer is NO! We are created for each other. No matter who we are, no matter how stone hearted we may be, every human being knows what they feel immediately they see the opposite sex, be it in the picture or physically. If you feel just likeness for someone, you know. If you feel you want someone to be yours forever, you also know.

All these feelings are our bodies telling us what they want. But instead of most people giving their bodies and spirit what they want, they tend to give them bad food, I mean bad partners.

And you know, the bodies will reject them either immediately or someday. You might have been through a terrible past and hard life just like me, but it shouldn't destroy our yet to come, beautiful future. life is so short, And if we close our eyes and wait for all the bad people of this world to pass by, the good ones will also pass and we won't notice.

However Many people spend so much time thinking they can create love. NO! That is impossible but only a waste of time. If truly, love can be created by mankind, we won't have any broken heart. Every relationship that takes long before the partners fall in love will have a happy end. But nah, most love life people spend time building often end in tragedy.

To be candid, which love are we building? A duplex or a mansion or a small room? Very funny! Or has anyone ever seen love physically? lol. It's not a human-created phenomenon, it's like a spirit, it enters into those who submit to it.  We all need to start seeing the other side of the coin because it is the side facing down, only powerful minds can see it. I want you to know today Kari, All of me Loves all of you.

**#Ai Updated**

I couldn‚Äôt sleep last night because thoughts of you filled every corner of my mind. The joy, the love, and the light you‚Äôve brought into my life are indescribable. I felt compelled to put my feelings into words, hoping you'd read this and feel the depth of my emotions.

Since you‚Äôve entered my life, you‚Äôve taught me so many lessons you may not even realize you‚Äôve given. Your kindness, care, and concern have touched me in ways I haven‚Äôt felt in years, not since I lost my family. You‚Äôve become more than just a part of my world you‚Äôre the closest thing to the family I have now.

You know, my grandson Willian grew up without the warmth of a mother‚Äôs love. I‚Äôve done my best to be both his father and his mother, but it hasn‚Äôt been easy for either of us. When I told him about you, I saw something in him I hadn‚Äôt seen in a long time pure joy, excitement, and happiness. It‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve felt his happiness radiate like that, and I knew then that you weren‚Äôt just changing my life you were touching his too.

Willian has endured so much loss at such a young age losing both his mother and grandmother. It‚Äôs no wonder he‚Äôs excited about you. Even though he hasn‚Äôt said it out loud, I know deep down he craves that motherly love he‚Äôs been deprived of for so long. I‚Äôve always prayed for someone with a heart as big and kind as yours, someone who would love and cherish him as much as I do. Gisela, the love you‚Äôve showered upon me means the world, and I hope one day you‚Äôll share that same love with him.

My thoughts of you fill every part of my day and night. You‚Äôre doing something magical to my heart, and I hope I‚Äôm doing the same for you. After all these years, I never thought I‚Äôd find my dream woman, the one who‚Äôs my partner, my best friend, my co-pilot in life. But here you are, my Queen, making me believe in love again.







I‚Äôm not afraid of what lies ahead because I know true love isn‚Äôt about finding the perfect person, it‚Äôs about creating the perfect relationship. It‚Äôs not about how much love we start with, but how much love we nurture and build as time goes on. And no matter the distance between us, if it‚Äôs meant to be, our hearts will always find each other. When our hearts finally melt into one, our bodies and souls will follow, igniting a flame that no time or distance can extinguish. I‚Äôll be yours, and you‚Äôll be mine, for now and forever.

Reflecting on all our conversations and the journey we‚Äôve taken to know each other, I can proudly say: ‚ÄúI love you ‚Äù I want you to look at our pictures and ask yourself could anyone else in this world match what we have? My answer is clear: No. We were made for each other. No matter how tough or guarded we might be, deep down, we all know when we‚Äôve found ‚Äúthe one.‚Äù And I know, with every fiber of my being, that you are the one for me.

Life is too short to wait for the bad moments to pass before embracing the good. You and I have both faced difficult pasts, but I believe in the beautiful future waiting for us. I don‚Äôt want us to miss a single moment of it.

People often think they can create love, but love isn‚Äôt something you build like a house. It‚Äôs a force that finds you, that fills you if you‚Äôre open to it. You can‚Äôt force it, but when it‚Äôs real, like what we have, it grows naturally and becomes unstoppable.

My Queen, you are the love of my life. ‚ÄúAll of me loves all of you‚Äù
