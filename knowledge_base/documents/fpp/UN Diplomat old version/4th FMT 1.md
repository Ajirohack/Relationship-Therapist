It’s 16 degree here in Sofia, it sunny, bright and beautiful. I just had my second cup of coffee for the day, I love coffee a lot. I like to have it with milk and no sugar, it makes me focus for the day ahead and looking sharp. Tell me do you prefer coffee or tea?

<span style="color:#ff12ffff;">Thank you for always taking your time to respond to me even with your tight schedule. I just want to let you know I really appreciate every effort in checking up on me.</span> 

<span style="color:#ff12ffff;">Today I will be starting my day by 11 Am, I will be having a meeting with some delegations from Africa Union, European Union and UN to discuss the current situation in Sudan. There is a war going on between Sudan's military and the country's main paramilitary force which has killed hundreds of both Sudanese and foreigners. As a diplomatic expert in conflict resolution I have been appointed to head the delegation meeting.</span>

<span style="color:#ff12ffff;">Oh Evgenia, I’m sorry if I bore you with my work stuffs, but honestly, I feel comfortable talking about myself because it’s been long I had a friend to talk to, so do not blame me going too forward with my discussions. Beside that, I also love discussing about politics as one of my hobbies, but when am not discussing politics, I also enjoy taking a long walk; going to the beach, swimming, fishing, playing pool, sport and I like anything that has to do with the enjoyment of water or listening to the waves of the beach alongside with a cool music. Tell me Evgenia, what do enjoy doing when you are not working, taking care of a patient or taking care of the family?</span>

Ana, should I say you are not just a beautiful woman you are also hardworking, I don’t know much about the tourism sector, except the hotel business. Do you work as a tour guide or as a travel agent? 

Today, my day started at 11 Am, I had a meeting with some delegates from Africa Union, European Union, and UN to discuss the current situation in Sudan. There is a war of power going on between Sudan's military and the country's main paramilitary force which has killed hundreds of both Sudanese and foreigners. As a diplomatic expert in conflict resolution, I have been appointed to head the delegation meeting.

Oh, Ana, I’m sorry if I bore you with my work stuff, but honestly, I feel comfortable talking about myself because it’s been a long I had a friend to talk to, so do not blame me for going too forward with my discussions. Besides that, I also love discussing politics as one of my hobbies, but when am not discussing politics, I also enjoy taking a long walk; going to the beach, swimming, fishing, playing pool, and sports, and I like anything that has to do with the enjoyment of water or listening to the waves of the beach alongside with cool music. Tell me, Ana, what do enjoy doing when you are not working even though I know you work all the time *wink*.

Talk to you later, have a stress-free day at work, my good friend, Ana.

Thank you for always taking the time to respond to me and your lovely compliments. I really enjoy reading your replies and appreciate every effort, you put into it.

Oh Valeta, I’m sorry if I bore you with my work stuff, but honestly, I feel comfortable talking about myself because it’s been a long time since I had a friend to talk to, so do not blame me for going too forward with my discussions. Besides that, I also love discussing politics as one of my hobbies, but when I am not discussing politics, I also enjoy taking a long walk; going to the beach, swimming, fishing, playing pool, and sports, and I like anything that has to do with the enjoyment of water or listening to the waves of the beach alongside with cool music. Tell me Valeta, how do you enjoy your weekend, or weekdays when you are not busy?

I also admit, I have also tried having conversations with some women here, but unfortunately for me, they all turned out to be profile grabbers, scammers who just wanted my money. Funny, I almost fell for one in particular, lol. You wouldn’t blame me, I just wanted someone who I could talk to, or share my heart with, I just wanted Love. Well, that’s that. So are you still in a relationship conversation with anyone, what happened, it didn’t work. 

Being the opposite sex, I never expect that we will get along this easily, but suddenly your unique personality made you an inseparable part of my life. I value you and our friendship beyond what I can describe.

Good Night, Valeta.

By the way, I love your home,  you do own the apartment or rented. I own my house back n Sydney, but sincerely it surely needs the touch of a woman, wow, just look how clean and well-arranged your house is. Also, is that you in the photos? honestly am thinking maybe that's an angel? If that's you, you should be in heaven, such beauty.

I'm still surprised you are single, with no online relationship or offline relationship since you lost your husband. I tried having conversations with some women here, but unfortunately for me, they all turned out to be profile grabbers and scammers who just wanted my money. Funny, I almost fell for one in particular, lol. You wouldn’t blame me, I just wanted someone who I could talk to, or share my heart with, I just wanted Love. Well, that’s that.

Ps. Quick one my Angel, with our vast talents in multiple language, do i continue to write you in Italian, Romanian or .... Maybe Japanese this time. 

Good Night, Dorina.
