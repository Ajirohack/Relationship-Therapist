===========================

My love, I want to share something special with you that came up today. My grandson Willian sent me an email, and I was so touched by his words. He spoke about you, even though you haven’t met yet, and I translated it into Hungarian so you could read it yourself. I think it will show you just how much you already mean to him. 😊

**After Sending the Screenshot:**

My love, I wanted you to read his words directly because I feel it’s important for you to see how much love he already has for you, even without meeting you. It warms my heart to know that you’ve touched his life in such a profound way, just as you’ve touched mine. ❤️

**Follow-Up Message (Later in the Day or Next Day):**


My dearest Queen, I found myself thinking of you in the middle of the night when sleep wouldn’t come. There are so many thoughts and questions on my mind, but I want to take my time asking them, because they’re deeply personal to me.

My dearest, Willian isn’t just my grandson, he’s my entire world. He’s the last connection I have to my late daughter and wife. I’ve done my best to be everything he needs, but deep down, I know he craves a kind of love that I alone can’t provide.

I hope you don’t mind me asking, but I want to know what’s in your heart.
How do you feel about Willian?
Could you see yourself taking him into your heart and treating him as your own grandchild?
Would you be able to show him the love and care he so deeply deserves?
Could he look to you as a mother figure, someone who he can call ‘Mom’ and find comfort in?

These are big questions, and I know they come with great responsibility. But I trust you with everything that matters to me, Maria. Thank you for being the light in my life.

Good night, my Queen. Sleep well, and may the angels watch over you. ❤️
