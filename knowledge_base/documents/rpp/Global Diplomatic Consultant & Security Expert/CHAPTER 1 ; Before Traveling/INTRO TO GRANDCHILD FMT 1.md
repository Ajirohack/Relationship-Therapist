“My dearest Maria,

I couldn’t sleep well last night because thoughts of you filled every corner of my mind. The joy, the love, and the light you’ve brought into my life are indescribable. I felt compelled to share my thoughts, hoping you’d read this and feel the depth of my emotions.

Since you’ve come into my life, you’ve taught me so much through your kindness, care, and gentle soul. You’ve reminded me of feelings I haven’t felt in years, not since I faced the loss of my family. You’ve become more than just a part of my life—you’re the closest thing to family I have now.

Maria, I’d like to tell you about someone very special in my life: my grandson Willian. He’s an incredible boy, filled with so much potential, but life hasn’t been kind to him. Losing his mother and grandmother at such a young age left a void that I’ve tried my best to fill. I’ve been both his father and his mother, but it hasn’t been easy for either of us.

When I told him about you, Maria, his face lit up in a way I hadn’t seen in years. He was so happy, and it reminded me of how important love and connection are for him, just as they are for me. Even though he hasn’t said it outright, I know he craves that motherly love he’s been missing.

You have a heart as big and kind as I’ve ever known. The love you’ve shown me means the world, and I can only hope that one day, you’ll share that same love with him. He deserves to feel the warmth and care that only someone like you can provide.

Maria, my thoughts of you fill every part of my day and night. You’re doing something magical to my heart, and I hope I’m doing the same for you. After all these years, I never thought I’d find my dream woman—my partner, my best friend, my co-pilot in life. But here you are, my Queen, making me believe in love again.

True love isn’t about finding the perfect person; it’s about creating the perfect relationship. And that’s what I want with you—a love that grows stronger with every passing moment. Even though we may be apart right now, I believe that if it’s meant to be, our hearts will always find each other.

When I think of our journey so far, I feel so grateful. I love you, Maria. I can proudly say that now, because in my heart, I know that you are the one for me.

Life is too short to wait for the bad moments to pass before embracing the good. We’ve both faced difficult pasts, but I believe in the beautiful future waiting for us. I don’t want us to miss a single moment of it.

Maria, you are the love of my life, and I look forward to every step we take together. ❤️”

Maria, my love… last night, I couldn’t sleep well. My mind was restless, filled with thoughts of you.

Maria, I want to tell you about someone very special in my life. Someone who means the world to me—my grandson, Willian.

**Diego:**
He’s an incredible boy, full of potential and strength. But life hasn’t been easy for him. He lost his mother and grandmother at such a young age… and since then, I’ve been his everything—his father, his mother, his entire family.

**Diego:**
I’ve done my best to be there for him, to raise him with love. But Maria… it hasn’t been easy. He’s grown up without that soft, nurturing presence that only a mother’s love can provide.

**Diego:**
And when I told him about you…

**Diego:**
Maria, his face lit up like I hadn’t seen in years.

Maria, you have the kindest heart I’ve ever known. The love you’ve shown me already means the world. And I can only dream that one day, you’ll share that same love with him.

**Diego:**
You don’t know how much that would mean to me… how much that would mean to him.

**Diego:**
I see the way you care, the way you love, the way you make me feel. And I know that if Willian were to feel even a fraction of that, his world would change forever.

**Diego:**
Maria, I think of you every moment of the day. You’ve done something to my heart, something I never expected to feel again.

**Diego:**
After all these years, I never thought I’d find my dream woman. My best friend. My partner. My Queen.

**Diego:**
But then… there was you.

🔹 *If Maria expresses love or deep emotions → Strengthen future visioning & love reinforcement.*
🔹 *If Maria remains reflective → Reassure and express gratitude.*

**Diego:**
Maria, love isn’t about finding someone perfect. It’s about creating something real, something lasting.

**Diego:**
And I want that with you.

**Diego:**
Even though we’re apart right now, I believe our hearts will always find their way back to each other.

**Diego:**
I love you, Maria. I can finally say it with pride, because in my heart, I know you are the one for me.
