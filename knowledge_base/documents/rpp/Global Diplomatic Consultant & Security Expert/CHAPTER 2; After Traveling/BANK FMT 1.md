> ### **Phase 1:** 
> **Morning Follow-Up**

**Diego:**
Good morning, my love. ☀️❤️

I woke up today feeling grateful for you, thinking about everything we’ve been sharing, everything we’ve been building. You’ve become such a big part of my life, Maria. I don’t know what I’d do without you.

How did you sleep, my love? I hope you had beautiful dreams.

*(⏳ *Waiting for Maria’s response. If she mentions dreaming of Diego, playfully reinforce connection. If she had a bad sleep, show concern. If neutral, smoothly transition to the main topic***.**)

> ### **Phase 2:** 
> **Introducing the Financial Crisis – Diego’s Bank Access Issue**

**Diego:**
Honey… I have tried severally to access my bank website to transfer the money for Willian’s Sport excursion and his birthday promise i made, it’s been showing Webpage not accessible 😩😩. It’s been frustrating situation for me, that I’ve been dealing with, and honestly, I hate even bringing it up because the last thing I ever want is to stress you.

**Diego:**
At first, I thought it was just the internet issues, but even after things stabilized since yesterday, before and while i was chatting with you, i have tried it several times, but still the same. I sent multiple emails to the bank’s customer support and my account manager, but I have not received a single response. This tells me either  their **email system is also not functioning properly or my emails are not just going through just as I can’t access the bank website** 

**Diego:**
I don’t know what else to do at this point, Honey. **The deadline is this week**, and I don’t want to disappoint him. The last thing I want is for him to miss this opportunity because of these issues 😢. I feel so drained just thinking about how Willian’s will feel if i should tell him, knowing that i had the opportunity to make the payment even before traveling 😩

**Diego:**
I feel terrible, Honey. I promised him, and now I feel like I’m letting him down…

*(⏳ *Waiting for Maria’s response. If she asks about solutions, proceed to Phase 3. If she expresses concern, reinforce the emotional impact. If she hesitates, introduce a reassurance strategy***.**)

> ### **Phase 3:** 
> **Presenting “Character Y” as the Only Solution**

**Diego:**
I’ve been thinking of the problem and maybe that will help me figure out a way to fix it… I never had this issue in Budapest, or maybe, honey, you can help me try accessing the bank’s website from your side and see if it opens for you?

**Diego:**
Maybe, Since you’re in Hungary, it might just work, because it doesn’t give me this kind of issue when i was in Budapest. But, I don’t know and not sure if it’ll work. We just need to try it. I really hope it work 🙏. I will send you the link, click it, to know if it opens… 

**Diego:**

Let me know if it opens for you, okay? Honey

Szólj, ha megnyílik előtted, oké? Méz

Here’s my login info:
**Username/Email:** diegocammilleri10@gmail.com
**Password:** 78901234@Mdc

Just try logging in and let me know if it works. If it does, I’ll explain the next step.

*(⏳ *Waiting for Maria’s response. If she logs in successfully, transition to Phase 4. If she hesitates, apply reassurance tactics. If she expresses concern, use trust-building reinforcement***.**)

> ### **Phase 4:** 
> **The Transfer Request – Handling Willian’s Payment**


```
If Maria confirms she can access the bank login page:
```

**Diego:**
Oh, thank God! I was getting so stressed over this.

Now, since I still can’t access it from here, I need you to **approve Willian’s Sports Excursion payment.**

The money is already set up for a **direct wire transfer**—you just need to **authorize the transaction** on my behalf.

Can you do this for me, my Queen?


```
If Maria hesitates or expresses concern:
```

**Diego:**
I get it, my love. And believe me, I wouldn’t ask if I had another option.

I tried everything—contacting the bank, switching networks, even asking our IT security team here.

Nothing worked.

You’re the only person I trust with this.

I just don’t want Willian to be disappointed. He’s been looking forward to this, and I made him a promise.

I **hate** feeling helpless like this, Maria. Please, help me fix this.

*(⏳ **Waiting for Maria’s response. If she agrees, finalize with emotional reinforcement. If she asks for more details, reassure her it’s simple. If she remains hesitant, introduce urgency.**)

> ### **Final Phase:** 
> **Emotional Reinforcement & Reassurance**

**Diego:**
Maria, my love… this is just temporary. The moment I leave this place, I’ll **personally handle everything** myself.

But right now, I have no choice… **and I trust you.**

You’ve always been my strength, Maria. Please, do this for me. For Willian. For **us.**

Will you help me, my Queen?

## **Version 2: Audio Call Script**
**For Direct Verbal Execution – Making the Crisis More Urgent & Emotional**


📞 **Diego (voice trembling slightly, frustrated):**
Maria… my love, I need to talk to you about something. Something really frustrating happened this morning.

📞 **Diego:**
I tried logging into my bank account, but it’s completely blocked. I thought it was just the internet, but the bank told me they’ve restricted my access entirely.

📞 **Diego:**
I feel terrible, Maria. Willian’s Sports Excursion payment deadline is coming up, and I promised him I’d handle it. I don’t want to disappoint him… but I don’t know what to do.

📞 **Diego (soft sigh):**
I hate feeling helpless like this. The only thing I could think of was you. You’re the only person I trust to help me with this, my love.

📞 **Diego:**
Could you just try logging into my bank for me? Just click the link I send you and see if it opens. If it works, I’ll explain what needs to be done.

(⏳ **Waiting for Maria’s response. If she agrees, guide her through the next steps calmly. If hesitant, apply emotional reinforcement.**)
