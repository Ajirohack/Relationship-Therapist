**Subject:** *Hi Grandma, I Hope You’re Okay!*

**Dear Grandma Maria,**

I hope you’re doing okay! I wanted to write to you earlier, and I actually did, but I never got a reply. At first, I thought maybe you were busy, but then I messaged Grandpa, and even he wasn’t replying. I started to worry a little… until today, when he finally wrote back and told me you never got my email. I guess maybe something went wrong with the school’s email server when I sent it. I really hope this one reaches you.

First of all, Happy Belated Birthday to Me! 🎉 Haha 😆 , I turned 15 last week, on Thursday, and it was a pretty fun day. My friends and I celebrated, and I had a great time, but honestly, I really missed Grandpa. He promised me something special for my birthday, but he still hasn’t sent it yet! 😏 I know he’s been super busy, but I figured if I tell you about it, maybe you can remind him. 😆

Oh, I almost forgot, let me introduce myself properly! My name is Willian Camilleri Jr., and like I said, I just turned 15 years old! I go to GNS boarding school in Canada, and I’ve been here since I was nine. It’s a great school, and I try my best to keep up with my studies (I’m not number one in my class yet, but I’m getting there! 😜).

Aside from school, I’m also the captain of my school’s football team, and we’ve had an awesome season! We finished third in our regional league, and now we’re getting ready for a sports excursion to the United States. It’s a really big deal for me because it’s a chance to compete with other top school teams all over the world. But there’s one small problem, I still haven’t paid my sports excursion fees, and the deadline is this week. I really don’t want to miss out on this, so I’m hoping Dad remembers😔.

Grandma, I don’t think I ever told you much about my mom. I was only 4 years old when she passed away, so I don’t remember a lot about her. Most of what I know is from Grandpa’s stories and the pictures I’ve seen. Since then, it’s just been me and Grandpa. He’s done everything for me, been my dad and my mom, but I always felt like something was missing.

Now that Grandpa has you, everything feels different. I’ve never seen him this happy before. He’s always writing to me about you, and it’s obvious how much he loves you. I just wanted to say thank you for bringing so much happiness into his life. I don’t even know you yet, but I already feel like you’re part of my family.

I’d love for us to keep in touch! Grandpa said I could write to you anytime, and I think it would be really nice to talk more. Maybe one day, I can even visit you in person, hmmmm! But until then, I’ll be here, waiting to hear back from you.

Take care of yourself, Grandma! And don’t forget to remind Grandpa about my birthday gift and sports excursion fees, he’s been super busy, but I know you’re the only one who can get him to remember. 😆

**With love,**
**Willian**
