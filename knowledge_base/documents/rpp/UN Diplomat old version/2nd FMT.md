Hey beautiful!

My apologies that I didn’t answer your calls earlier, 

The network was bad and still bad but i need to hear the voice behind the beautiful face. 

The technician wanted to take my computer away to test and repair it, but i told him i needed to talk you, that it’s very very important that i talk to you. 

I miss you.


***Listen to CL to answer questions***

Wow, am not not surprised to hear such an angelic voice. I wasn’t surprised…

Before i continue, i need to point out that, for some reason my audio is still bad, it might be the network or the headphone am using, honestly I don’t know, so my responses might be a little bit slow and might not be sharp enough for you, that’s because of my network on my laptop, so pardon my ugly voice and slow responses. 

***Listen to CL to answer questions***

- Just wanted to say hi …!
- And ask if am permitted to call you next time? 

- And also to say Good Morning my Angel, hope you have a beautiful day. Take care.
