My love, I have been down since morning, sad and angry at the same time. 

I got to the office hoping to get my leave letter for tomorrow, as I waiting by my computer to receive the email, instead, I received an emergency delegation meeting prompt from our supervising office in the United States. 

It was a quick and sad meeting for me, they said the Council in charge of the peacekeeping project in the Middle East, concluded that I would be among the team along with ambassadors of countries to broker peace talks between Israel, Palestine, and Iran in Gaza.  To also, find a more diplomatic way to resolve the dispute between them.  

At the meeting when they made the announcement, I was just down, as you can see from the photo, I was smiling but I was sad at the sametime. All I was thinking was about you, how would you feel about this, will you be very upset about this? I don’t want to lose you because of this, would you see me less with this, I was just confused all day. I have called and try to discuss with my supervisors, to let them know i can’t go this weekend, that i have to be somewhere very important, but they said its impossible, they said I am the most qualified to and i will lead a section of the delegates, and with my expertise, if not me then who?… I don’t know what to do at this point, I don’t want to disappoint you. I have even started packing up. My queen, it’s just two weeks. We plan to have three separate dialogues with every party involved… so that won’t take time…The good news is that I have been informed that my contract expiration letter immediately after I return in two weeks, meaning I will be done Finally !!! Then we settle down and plan for our future without haste of going back to work the next day…

My Queen, it’s so unfortunate that i find myself in this situation, I am a man of my word and I promised you, I tried my best to fulfill my promise, this is my last diplomatic assignment, and probably my last time working… I really You can wait for me my love for these two weeks in the wild.

My Queen
I’ve been mentally, emotionally, and physically down since yesterday. I received some news that I’ve been dreading to tell you.

There was a network blackout on Saturday, and on Sunday morning, I was called to an emergency delegation meeting. Because of the internet issues, we had to move the meeting to a hotel. It was tough for me, and I felt completely overwhelmed. The Council in charge of the peacekeeping project in the Middle East has chosen me to be part of the team to broker peace talks between Israel, Palestine, and Iran. They’ve assigned me to lead a small group of experts and nation ambassadors to seek a lasting solution in Gaza. 

Honestly honey, when they made the announcement, I couldn’t help but think of you. I’ve been so torn inside thinking about how you’d feel if you were upset or disappointed with me. I even tried to tell my supervisors that I couldn’t go because I had to be somewhere important, but they insisted. They told me I’m the most qualified, and if not me, then who? I’m just so confused, my love because I don’t want to let you down.

It’s just for two weeks. We will have three separate dialogues with each party involved, so I’ll be back soon. The good news is that my supervisor promised they would sign my EOC Letter [End of Contract] as soon as possible, even before I return, so I won’t have to wait another two months to retire. This means that once this mission is done, I will come straight to you not for just a date, but to start planning our future together.

I know this is not what either of us wanted, and I’m so sorry to be in this position. But this is my last assignment, my last mission. After this, I’m yours completely, and we’ll finally have the time we deserve.

Please wait for me, my love, just two more weeks in the wild.

- Since I called you, my mind has been relaxed. I was afraid to upset you, that's how important you are to me. Thanks for your understanding, I promise you what I promised. Why so much love for me?
- I love you so much, I emailed Willian and told him. His response shows that he was angry that he could be dangerous because of the location… Sometimes I feel disappointed because I haven't been there for him, hmmm… He also said in anything I do 'don't let my step granny down and never break her heart'. 😅 kids 😏😏.
- That moment marked the first time you knew you loved me?
- I fell in love when you told me about you… A queen you shouldn't be alone under any circumstances… I was angry with myself during the time I didn't read you… maybe it was supposed to be like this? just maybe... i believe in soul mates, and we are meant to meet... No matter the time or age, but what matters most is having a happy ending... ❤️
- Before I forget, Willian also asked if you have an email address, so he can write to you one day, or you can wish him a happy birthday. Did I mention his birthday was Thursday next week?
