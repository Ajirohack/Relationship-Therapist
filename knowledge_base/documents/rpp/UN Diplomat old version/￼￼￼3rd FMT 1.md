**Message:**

My dear Maria,

Every day, when I wake up in my apartment at the UN house, I think about the tasks ahead and the people I work with. My team, 23 amazing individuals, feels like family as we work tirelessly to solve some of the world’s toughest conflicts.

Right now, we’re focused on finding a diplomatic solution to the ****** crisis. It’s heartbreaking to see the destruction **** has endured, especially knowing how it impacts innocent lives. I’ve included a link below so you can see for yourself.

Maria, sometimes I wish for a simpler life—a life where I can focus on peace and happiness rather than chaos. That’s why I feel so grateful for you. Our connection brings me so much joy and reminds me of the beauty life can offer, even amidst challenges.

I love how our relationship is progressing. I believe that strong foundations are built not just by meeting in person but through understanding, trust, and shared dreams. My late aunt used to say, *‘Love is worth it, even if it makes you look foolish.’* She was right, and I’m willing to embrace that with you. 😊

When I lost my wife, I was scared to love again. But now, I feel hopeful. Love truly has the power to turn even the darkest days into endless sunny ones. With you, Maria, I feel like anything is possible.

I understand that the language barrier might feel challenging at times, but I promise I’m a quick learner. Once my work commitments ease, I’ll have more time to immerse myself in learning your language and culture—it’s something I’m genuinely excited about.

Maria, I want to spend my life building something beautiful with you. Who says we can’t create our own paradise? It’s possible when we walk together, side by side.

What about you, my love? What does your dream life look like? I’d love to hear what you envision for us**.**

My dear Maria, I was imagining us designing our paradise together, just like I mentioned earlier. 😊

If you could choose one place in the world where we could build our dream life, where would it be? Somewhere warm and sunny, or maybe a cozy little village?

I’m curious to know what you’d pick because wherever you are feels like paradise to me. ❤️”


**Follow-Up Message 3: Affirming and Reassuring**

I’m so excited about what’s ahead for us and grateful to share this journey with you.
