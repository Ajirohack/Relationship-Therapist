Sorry for my bad manners my dear. My names are Aidan Brubaker, I hope you donâ€™t mind my name, hahaha. Iâ€™m from Australia, Sydney to be precise. Iâ€™m a diplomat with the United Nations Peacekeeping, working in Bulgaria for about six months now. Iâ€™m very glad that you taking the time to reply to my message even in your busy schedule with work, am very grateful. It's difficult moving around this platform, hahaha, I am more of a Classic man, don't laugh at me but I really don't know much about how social media works *, hence I donâ€™t use it most of the time, I only come only here when am lonely. But to be honest, staring at your profile picture, I must confess you are beautiful and charming at the same time. Penka, I hope I got it right.

I hope am not asking too much, but what's something that never fails to bring a smile to your face? I'd love to hear more about you, ******
