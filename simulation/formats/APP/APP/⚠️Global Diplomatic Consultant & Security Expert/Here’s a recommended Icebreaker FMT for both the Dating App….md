### **Icebreaker FMT for Dating App Version (DA Version)**

In the dating app context, the goal of the icebreaker is to **stand out** while showing genuine interest in the recipient’s profile.

**Icebreaker FMT Example:**  
*“I noticed you’re into [specific interest from their profile, e.g., hiking, cooking, or travel]. What’s the most memorable [related experience, e.g., hike, dish, or trip] you’ve ever had?”*

- It shows you’ve paid attention to their profile.  
- It invites them to share a personal story, which fosters connection.  
- It’s open-ended, encouraging a detailed response.
