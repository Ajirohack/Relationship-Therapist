My dear [Character Y’s Name],  
You know how much I value our conversations, but lately, my work has become incredibly demanding, and I find it harder to log into [Social Media Platform] to connect with you. Between the busyness and the strict security policies at my job, accessing personal social media accounts is nearly impossible during work hours.  

I’ve been thinking, do you use Skype? It’s a platform I use daily for work meetings and virtual calls, and it’s always open on both my computer and smartphone since it’s approved by my agency. I thought it might be easier and more convenient for us to stay connected there. What do you think? 😊  

If you’re open to trying it, I’d be happy to help you set it up or guide you through it. It’s really simple to use, and it could give us more opportunities to chat throughout the day, even during my busiest moments.  

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts, my dear ❤️

I’m so glad you’re open to trying Skype! 😊 Let me know if you need any help setting it up. Once you’re ready, we can exchange our contact details and give it a try.  

I’m really looking forward to chatting with you this way! This feels like another lovely step toward bringing us closer together. 🌹

Good morning, [Character Y’s Name]!
I hope you woke up to a beautiful day. 😊 Have you had a chance to think about trying Skype? I believe it could really help us stay connected more smoothly, especially given my unpredictable work schedule.  

If you have any questions or need assistance, just let me know! I’d be more than happy to help you with anything.

Dear [Character Y’s Name],  
I completely understand if you’re not ready to try Skype yet. If it feels like too much, another simple option could be WhatsApp. It’s very easy to use on both our phones, and it makes quick messaging very convenient. What do you think? 😊  

The most important thing to me is that we stay connected in a way that’s comfortable and natural for you. ❤️
