	•	If a format is ineffective, the system should reroute to a **backup strategy** (e.g., if FMT 4 is resisted, return to FMT 2).
	•	Use this template for **each new CL** to ensure their **FPP is tailored** to their unique profile.

This structured document provides a detailed **step-by-step framework** to **tailor** and **track the FPP** for each **Character Y (CL)**, helping to **optimize engagement** and **adapt strategies** as the process unfolds.
