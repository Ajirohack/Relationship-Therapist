**Revised Pullout Format FMT with Predicted Responses and Follow-ups**

**Initial Message (Morning):**

Good morning [Drótár B Anikó]!

I was just reflecting on how much I enjoy our conversations and realized how often I miss them during the day due to my work constraints. At work, we have strict rules against using personal social media, which makes it tough for me to log in during office hours.

I frequently use Skype for my work calls, and it’s always active on my devices since it’s approved for communication at my job. Have you ever used Skype? It might make it much easier for us to stay in touch throughout the day. What do you think about giving it a try? 😊

If you're open to it, I'd be glad to help you set it up. It's straightforward, and it could let us chat more often, even when I’m at work.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

**Follow-Up Message (Afternoon, after positive initial response):**

Hi [Drótár B Anikó],

That’s wonderful to hear! 😊 Setting up Skype is really easy, and I’m here to help you with every step. Once you’re set up, we can exchange Skype IDs and test it out. 

This could really help make our conversations more seamless. I’m looking forward to chatting in a way that’s easier for both of us!

Cheers,
Diego

**Day 2 Follow-Up (Morning):**

Hello [Drótár B Anikó],

Just wanted to check in and see if you had any thoughts about trying out Skype. I believe it could really enhance our communication, especially with my unpredictable work schedule.

If there’s anything you’re unsure about, or if you need help setting it up, don’t hesitate to ask. I’m more than happy to assist you.

Take care,
Diego

**Predicted Hesitation from Drótár B Anikó:**

“I’m a bit hesitant about installing new apps on my phone. I’m not very tech-savvy and worry about privacy.”

**Alternative Suggestion (Afternoon, if hesitant):**

Dear [Drótár B Anikó],

I completely understand your concerns about privacy and the hassle of new apps. How about we try WhatsApp instead? It’s another great tool that’s simple to use on our phones, and it’s very secure.

Let me know if this sounds like a good alternative to you! 😊 My priority is to ensure our communication is comfortable and natural for you.

All the best,
Diego

**Encouraging Closure (Evening):**

Hey [Drótár B Anikó],

Regardless of the platform, I just really look forward to our conversations. I hope this small change can make our connection even stronger and more frequent. 😊

Here’s to adapting and finding the best ways to keep our chats lively and engaging!

Warmest,
Diego
