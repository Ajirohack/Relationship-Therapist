Oh wow, looks beautiful. Do you know I have never been there, heard so much about the beauty, and I have tried making out time to visit but work has been so hectic, time just flies. Are you on holiday or vacation, or you are retired?

<span style="color:#ff12ffff;">My apologies for writing this email too late, like I told you work has been so so hectic.  How are you doing there, I hope you are having a great time so far with good weather conditions there…I have attached to this message some of my ugly photos, I hope you don’t laugh at me, hahaha. I don’t have many pictures in my work computer as most of my photos are on my hard drive back in Australia, but I hope you like these pictures and also send me some of your Photos. ********, like I have told you before, I’m from Australia, Sydney to be precise “the city where dreams come true”,  But I grew up in Paris, France. I was the only child of my parents, I went to Primary and high school in Egypt and Paris respectively, then we moved back to Australia when I was 15 years old.  My father was in the army and died after his retirement from a heart attack. My mother was a ********, she died when I was a baby, I still remember her face like it was yesterday. My father always Said ****** has the most beautiful women, I never believed not until I saw your profile.</span> 

 I was married and we had a daughter and Grandson but unfortunately, life wasn’t fair to me, I lost my wife and daughter the same day in a car accident on a trip to see my Grandson at his preschool graduation ceremony.  Since then, I have been a single father to my only grandchild, Willian. He was 4 years old when he told me that she wants to be a  medical doctor to help non-privileged orphans...

Currently, he is in boarding school in Canada, because I have not been around due to work activities, he said he wanted to study in Canada. I am a Diplomat on conflict and resolution with the United Nations peacekeeping initiative, I have been working in ****** for the past 6 months now, and I must say I have loved every bit of time I have spent here in the country and with the people, I guess because my mother was a ******, that’s why being connected to the people. I plan to settle down here as soon as my contract is done, which is soon. I hope we can friend, and you may want to show me around beautiful and lovely places in ******, hmm, what do you say, ******?

Once again my apologies for the late replies. May the restful night become the source of energy for a new day in your life! Wishing you a tight sleep and a good night!

It’s nice to meet you, *****, and thank you for your kind response. My apologies for the delay in replying; work has been incredibly hectic. How are you doing? I hope you’re having a great time and that the weather is lovely where you are.

I’ve attached some photos to this message. I hope they bring a smile to your face. Unfortunately, I don’t have many pictures on my work computer as most are stored on my hard drive back in Australia. I look forward to seeing some of your photos as well.

As I mentioned before, I’m from Napoli, Italy, but I grew up in Sydney, Australia “the city where dreams come true”. I was the only child of my parents. I attended primary school in Egypt and high school in Rome before moving back to Australia at age 15. My father, who was Italian, served in the army and passed away from a heart attack after his retirement. My mother was Austrian, and she died when I was a baby. I still remember her face as if it were yesterday. My father always said Austrian women are the most beautiful, and I never believed him until now.

I was married and had a daughter and a grandson. Tragically, I lost my wife and daughter in a car accident on their way to my grandson’s preschool graduation ceremony. Since then, I’ve been raising my only grandchild, William, as a single father. William was four years old when he told me he wanted to be a doctor to help underprivileged orphans. Currently, he’s in boarding school in Canada because my work keeps me away, and he wants to be with his friends who also study there.

As I mentioned, I am a diplomat specializing in conflict resolution with the United Nations peacekeeping initiative. I’ve been working in Europe (Austria, France, UK, Hungary…), But, for the past six months I have been stationed in the **Netherlands**, and I have enjoyed every moment. I feel a special connection to Europe, likely because of my family heritage. I plan to settle here once my contract ends, which will be soon. I hope we can become friends so you can show me around beautiful countries around Europe. What do you say, *****?

Once again, I apologize for the late reply and also for the lengthy message, i hope you don’t get bored when reading 🤭. Tell me, how is France? Where do you live in France…

I hope I can get to know you better my friend, *****. Enjoy the rest of your day, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
