Hello, my dear friend, Ana. How are you doing and how is work? I understand what you meant by working after retirement. Like I have told you previously, I work for the UN Peacekeeping, as a Diplomat in Conflict and Resolution in charge of European and African territories. I have been working here in Zagreb for about 6 months now, tasked with finding a diplomatic solution to Ukraine War, but now we are currently working on the Sudan Crisis. We are finding solutions to prevent a full out scale civil war in the Country. Ana, I know as a person in the Tourism sector, you may not find my work interesting, because it is actually boring, lol, but I want to share them with you because I believe the best way to earn a friend's trust is by being trustful. I want to open up to you and hope to know more about you, I guess already find myself a guide, lol. You can show me the rest of Croatia, interesting places where I can buy a house and settle down, I like a green environment just like in Sydney, Australia, where am from. I will be done with my contract with the UN Peacekeeping soon and that requires me to go back to Sydney. 

However, I have really got to fall in love with Croatian Culture. It is my dream to finally settle down with someone that will be very special to me and I wish to spend the rest of my life happily here since I have no one left in Australia besides my grandson who studies in the USA. I seek a fresh start and I don't think it's too late for that.

I received your photo and I must say with honesty, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL ANA. If you donâ€™t mind, I would love to know more about you. 

Are you married and do you have Children or Grand Children?
Do you live with your Family on the island of Punt?

<p style="text-align:justify;margin:0">Valeria, I got your email and I'm very pleased with the way you responded to me. As I told you earlier, whatever you need to know about me, just ask and I will honestly answer. I think you should know these as well.

I want to open up to you and hope to know more about you, I guess already find myself a Romanian guide, lol. You can show me the rest of Romania, interesting places. I will be joining you soon in the retirement sector and trustfully wish to start my life all over again with my only family, My Grandchild. 

After the unfortunate life event that took my happiness, it was very difficult for me and Willian, we suffered a lot, but we raised and moved on, I focused all these years of my life to my career. I mean after getting to the top of success, I have come to realise that we are nothing without a partner. I mean someone who would stand by me no matter the situation. A woman who I can say, she alone has the right to be womanly irritating to me (lol). A witch who would protect me like a lioness would do her cub (lol). And I can promise to protect her beyond all vices. I have really worked hard in the past years to get to this height. I have seen faces of women on this site, many of whom have been taken for granted, many of whom are not being reciprocated, but I have come with a good news and a bad news.

I noticed I didnâ€™t attach any photos, my mistake, I have attached some to the message. Valeria, I will be going to bed now, but I would like to know, if you donâ€™t mind. As a pensioner, how do you survive the economic hardship that we face in our current societies, and where did you work before been pensioned?  

Good night, my friend! May you have a great day tomorrow.
