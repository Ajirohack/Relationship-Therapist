<p style="text-align:justify;margin:0">I must say dear friend, you are truly blessed, so many will wish to have the family you have, me included. Like told you before, Ana. My life story is unfortunate, I watched my wife and only daughter, Agnes lying dead in a pool of blood!!! As much as I adore my family, the inevitable death took them all in one day and life suddenly turned around my table of great joy into a terrible agony. Such is life!.Â Sometimes we pass through situations we do not have control of and we only do nothing but bear whatever it is. I have to move on not only for myself but for the sake of my grand daughter Emily. Sheâ€™s the only family i have left. 

Iâ€™m a bit confused at same time surprised that a beautiful lady like you will be single in Croatia? Or do I say the men around you are just blind to see such beauty? Tell me Ana, were you married? Because Iâ€™m in shock that an intelligent, kind-hearted and most especially beautiful woman will still be single when it rare to meet such in our current society. 

Ana, I'm always very pleased with the way you respond to me, Ana, I know this is to early, but I pray and Hope we can keep this communication going so we get to know each other better. 

Iâ€™m really thinking of hanging the hat this year after my contract here in Sofia. Been through many ups and downs in life, yet, I am blessed in some other ways. I mean after getting to the top of success, I have come to realize that we are nothing without a partner. I mean someone who would stand by me no matter the situation. It is my dream to finally settle down with someone that will be very special to me and I wish to spend the rest of my life happily here and since I have no one left in the Australia besides grand-daughter who study in the USA. I seek a fresh start and I don't think its too late for that.

I must say, dear friend, you are truly blessed, so many will wish to have the family you have, me included. Like told you before, Ana. My life story is unfortunate, I watched my wife and only daughter, Agnes lying dead in a pool of blood!!! As much as I adore my family, the inevitable death took them all in one day and, life suddenly turned from my table of great joy into a terrible agony.

Tell me, Ana, were you married? Because Iâ€™m in shock that an intelligent, kind-hearted, and most especially beautiful woman will still be single when it is rare to find such a woman in our current society. 

Ana, donâ€™t laugh at me, Iâ€™m a bit of a classic man who doesnâ€™t really know much about these modern social media platforms, hahaha. I only come online here just to keep myself busy when am on break or not working, not until I came across your profile. I'm always very pleased with the way you respond to me, Ana, I know this is too early, but I pray and Hope we can keep this communication going so we get to know each other better.

Ana, I have come to observe that you are mostly not frequent here on Instagram it could be probably because of your work or other things, If you are more frequent on Skype I would like for us to talk more on Skype in other to get to know more about each other

I hope I donâ€™t bore you with my lengthy messages, lolâ€¦Pardon me, I have noticed you are not much of a writer or you simply do not have the time to write much. I love to write a lot, I tend to express myself more when writing, I even wanted to be a writer when I was much younger, but you know, life happened lol. Ana, I can go on and on writing to you if given the chance honestly. I really do enjoy our conversation, you seem to be an intelligent, honest, and kind lady. If you donâ€™t mind, I would like to have more of this conversation more often. As I said we all need friends and I would appreciate us being friends. 

What are your plans for the weekend, do you work during the weekend? For me, myself and my team go out on social visits to Orphanages and care homes for support. 

Have a beautiful night's rest, my dear friend, hope to read from you tomorrow. 

===========================================


Valeria, how glad and relieved to hear you find my messages amazing to read, wow, do you know I always wish you reply to me whenever I send you lengthy messages because I feel you might find them boring or lengthy to read? Thank you for the kind words, my dear friend. I love writing, and love to express myself when writing especially to someone important to me. In fact, I have always wanted to be a writer, but maybe after my retirement, I might think about it again, What do you think Valeria? You can be my co-author, hahaha. 

Once again, I am glad I could lighten you with my words and I appreciate you so much for always taking the time to reply to my lengthy messages. Yes, I have had a wonderful career, but Valeria, what is a successful career when in the end you still have no one by your side when celebrating your success? I believe a good life is a successful life, and the key element of having a good life is HAPPINESS. 

Valeria, Itâ€™s been a long time since I wrote to anyone expressively like this, maybe because you are the only friend I have had for a long long time after the unfortunate life event that tore my life apart. Or maybe because I am naive to the social media trend that no one finds me attractive enough to even say hello. Lol {laugh emoji}, donâ€™t laugh at me, Iâ€™m a bit of a classic man who doesnâ€™t really know much about these modern social media platforms, hahaha. I only come online here just to keep myself busy when am on break or not working, not until I came across your profile. I'm always very pleased with the way you respond to me, Valeria, I know this is too early, but I pray and Hope we can keep this communication going so we get to know each other better. 

Ever since we started writing to each other as friends, I see you as a kindhearted, honest, caring, and humble woman. Valeria, you donâ€™t need a degree or high education certificate to be a queen, you just need a good heart and kindness and honesty, to be you are a Queen, simply because you have what it takes to be.

Hope you donâ€™t mind my curiosity, how do you survive on the little pension paid by the company and government? I understand because it can be quite frustrating in this current economy. Also, Valeria, how long have you been on social media, have you considered or been in a relationship offline and online?
