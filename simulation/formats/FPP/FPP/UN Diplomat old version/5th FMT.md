Hello Ana, how are you, I know you will be fast asleep by now,…I was waiting for your message all through the day hoping you do check on up me, what an ambitious thinking, lol. I so much love your message even though they are brief, but they leave me with so much hope, anticipation, and happiness that we can someday become friends. There has been this joy in me since we started writing to one another, is the best I have felt so far in many years and I pray it grows and never dies. Wow you are a special lady and your past is not the future, We should keep on going forward. Hopefully to grow more with you.

I can feel you understand the true meaning of love, happiness and to stand by the man you love... That is a rear spec to find these days from ladies. But I have this feeling that we started on the right track and headed in the right direction. I pray with joy in my heart we keep the fire burning.

I had wonderful life with my wife and we both built a family even though God didn’t bless us much with Children, we were grateful. But unfortunately, Life took them back from me in a sad way, I guess we don’t always get what we want. That is why for us to get that type of relationship that will last the test of time, it must be built on a strong foundation. The lack of a strong foundation is what makes a relationship these days fall/break easily, I hope you understand my point.

Ana, can't wait to get retired, the good thing is I will be finishing my project soon in less than two weeks and after that, I will be retired. There are a lot of things I would love us to do when we are together and spend the pretty time of life to attain happiness of life. Happiness is the key to life.
 
Oh, Ana,  For I know with faith I have found what I'm looking for, Having faith and being positive is the best way to archive a goal and the goal is to have a good companionship.

Ps: If you have a chance to make three wishes what will it be?

By the way, about so many Americans or so they claim they are carrying out fraudulent activities, scamming and stealing profiles of Men and women, most always claiming they are from the United State and United Kingdom, seriously it’s exhausting. How was your encounter between the Americans or wherever they are actually from? some times am marvelled how they tend to carry out their acts. I hope you didn’t fall for any of them my dear.

Without taking much of your time with my usual lengthy boring messages, hahaha. My Beautiful Dorina,

Hello my dear ******, how are you, I have been off social media for a while due to work stuff and meetings intensifying, lol, I understand what you must be thinking “Even during the Holidays”, Yes believe me or not, I didn’t enjoy my holiday. Even with a few days off, it was all about work.  So I didn’t get to spend time with my Grandson Willian. Enough of me, My dear, how did you spend your holiday? Hope you had a lot of fun with your family.
