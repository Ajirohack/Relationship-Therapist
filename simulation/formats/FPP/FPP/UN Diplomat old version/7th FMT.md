Every time I read from you Valeria, you leave me with so much conviction of your Queen status. I mean, you are so humble and kind-hearted, you are open and honest, what more do you need to possess to be called a Queen? 

Replying late again Valeria, is becoming a bad habit and I will have to find a way around it because I always want to read from you. Work stress can take your time off reality sometimes and you can even lose track of time, I believe you can relate even though I don‚Äôt know the world of a nurse. I don‚Äôt want to bore you with my day-at-office talk because it's always politics, lol. but the summary is, ‚ÄúIt's been very hectic‚Äù.  

Honestly, I love you the way you pour out your feelings with utmost sincerity my dear, it really shows how virtuous you are my dearest friend. When I met my wife, I can say I was the happiest man on the planet, but when the unfortunate happened I thought I lost my joy and happiness forever. But here I am at my age still searching for happiness, love, and comfort. I have always thought of giving up so many times, but how can someone give up in search of Happiness in his/her life? 

Valeria, I was not in your past, so I can‚Äôt pretend to know how you felt, but Valeria, let me be in your present and future

Let me treat you as the Queen you are.
Let me cure your past and present wounds. 
Let me be the doctor to heal your pains.  

I want to be open to you, and if you need to know anything about me, always ask me. Can I write to you through email, whenever am not online here? If yes, here is my cammilleridiego@outlook.com, or we can always chat or talk easily through Skype, whichever is preferable for you. I don‚Äôt mind. 

I will stop here and will be going to bed now, here is a flower for a beautiful night's rest my Friend, Valeria.
