Timeline & Routine Tree(scheduler):

old/past/template Formats: These are set of deliberate, organized and arranged Formats (Long and short messages, contents, actions, gestures, emoji sent to a CL to convey a specific message/context to achieve an aim). These Old Formats are old versions and can be modified if needed to achieve the desired result. Find Attached documents for your perusal

wooing 3 Phase: DC 3 Processes of opening up to CL about his intentions towards her. First Phase; Initiate Flirting and Subtly communicating Love and affection and how much she has changed his life and her impact in his life and the feelings you have started developing for her. Second phase; the all push for DC to CL stage to fully make her aware of his intentions towards her. the full wooing package. Third phase; final wooing stage to get a result of either yes or no (because without the result, no relationship to initiate), so it’s very important for CL to accept the wooing phase

### Prompt to; Extract Friendship Path Process from The Relationship path process:
Using the idea (not all) behind the “Relationship Path Plan”, generate a detailed instructions to setup a “Friendship Path planner” that will help Diego Camilleri “DC”, start, nurture, build, grow, and develop Friendships with CLs (all CL profiled by CPP, if the CL is not profiled yet, Prompt “CL not profiled, profile CL, review CL, and generate Report of CL). 

After the profiling of a CL by Character Profiler process “CPP”, a detailed and comprehensive Review Report is made available to (me) DC. With that report which may or may not contains the followings depending on what data/information/details are available;
-Analysis done on the specimen (files) or Chat histories of DC and CL
-*comprehensive assessment of the interactions between Diego Camilleri (DC) and Margit, focusing on emotional, psychological, and cultural dynamics*
-**Readiness for Friendship Process (FP)**
**-Cultural and Psychological Readiness:** Her enjoyment of cultural content and psychological comfort with DC support moving forward with more structured interactions.
-**Recommendation for Friendship Path processor Initiation:** a well structured instructions, recommendations, suggestions, analyzed and found problems and issues or conflicts within her that may cause problems, so that the **“Friendship Path processor”** can have the required information to generate a robust and tailored Friendship Path Framework to facilitate the process of achieving the aims and objectives of DC (earning her friendship)
### Process involved:
- The Friendship Path Processor uses the “Review Report” generated after the end/completion of Acquaintance Process “AP”, and old/past/template Formats (*used previously; now used as a template, if required*) to generate a Framework; a framework that combine ideas, methodologies and structure of Timeline & Routine Tree(scheduler), with current conversations/chat’s between DC and CL (*if any)*, and Dynamism, Concurrently to generate *(continuously)* updated, tailored, structured and dynamic Formats(format process)(FMT) that will help Diego Camilleri “DC”, start, nurture, build, grow, and develop open and trustworthy Friendships with CLs he meets online/on the internet/social media Platforms… His aim is to win them as friends at the end of the FP process and eventually carry out a Review Process to determine is Progress so far, know current situations with her and proceed to Relationship Path Planner/Processor if deemed recommended by the Review Report.
- The FP processor must be systematically authorized (can be plainly written or not. And can be subtly systematically written or suggested) by Review Report (copied to use) before the process can “start”. If not written authorization, or recommendation to start or systematic writeup that means” you can proceed” literally or not.

**Output:** Three output after the generation Process of Friendship Path Processor. 
Brief overview of the CL using the 
- It will output a structured Frameworks tailored for the particular CL. 
- Generated information on the result will include with other information or output welcomed if needed;
	- Framework; Brief overview of Recommended steps, processes and procedures. Including Method, adjustments etc…
	- Tailored Timeline & Routine Tree (Scheduler) for the particular CL Framework, automatically adjustable to reflect conversations, chat, messages between DC and CL updates , and also provides routes in-case of planned / scheduled Formats that couldn’t be administered due to time mismatch or lack of time or space. And this should be presented in a well formatted structured Table, that shows the Timeline (time and date schedule for each Format process and procedures to be carried out), Follow-ups and Routines (routine tree, period, session of the day) to administer the formats properly with room for changes… 
	- End of the FP process Review Mechanism, 
	- Issues and problems found in the AP Review Report and analyze processes to solve the problems
	- Implement Feedback Mechanisms
	- Regular Reviews
=====================
Old/previous Format Templates(each Format file (.pdf)contains; several altered versions of the same Format) :

1st FMT: To fully introduce DC and his Job to CL
2nd FMT: To fully tell her about DC job, and how long you have been in “Germany” [placeholder for CL home / current country of residence, which is also the same as the current location pf DC office for about six months]. The aim of this FMT is to subtly find out if someone(anyone she as met online/over the internet or social Media/Dating platforms) who has introduced himself to her as a Diplomat as attempted or succeeded in Scamming /defrauding her. 
3rd FMT: To deepen the conversations, by letting in her yo your past, and other relevant talk. With the aim of opening her up. by telling her about my past, what i wish for and trying to find out how far she has been using the internet, if she has met anyone (friend or relationship) on the internet, about her experience. Because these experiences can make any lady lost trust and have doubts due to the trauma it must have caused. 
4th FMT: DC open more about himself. Which is his everyday job at the office, recent work mission and tasks. Aim to continue building on openness, to make her comfortable with chatting with DC.
5th FMT: DC talk more about his future, letting the CL know that, he plans to live in Germany [placeholder for CL home/current location  (country) which is always the same location (country) with DC’s current office location. Aim is to continue building openness (because openness is a good way to start developing trust), and also, trying to know more about her schedule and her daily routine… And This FMT marks the introduction of the “wooing 3 phase” 
6th FMT: 2 wooing phase: deep into sharing your love and affection for her. All love and affection that DC feel for CL and how he plans to make her a Queen…Aim is to psychologically infuse the idea of having a relationship with DC, by clearing all analyzed doubts, issues and problems
7th FMT: Romance and Love message, just the last phase of the wooing phrase to push the initiation of a relationship with her. Aim is to finally get a relationship stance with her and remove her from the Social Media Platform DC as been chatting her to a more secured communication platform such as; WhatsApp, Skype, Telegram, E.T.C….   As Skype been the favored…
