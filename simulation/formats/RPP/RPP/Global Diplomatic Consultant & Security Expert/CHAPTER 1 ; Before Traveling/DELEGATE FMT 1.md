**Message** 
**Delegate FMT Administration**

My love, my heart has been so heavy today. 💔 I’ve been struggling to find the right words because I don’t want to cause you any worry. But you are my world, Maria, and you deserve honesty above all else.

This morning, I was called into an emergency delegation meeting. I knew something serious was happening, but I never expected this… The Council overseeing the peacekeeping project in [Crisis Region] has made a final decision, I am to be part of the lead delegation team. The situation has escalated dangerously, and if we do not act now, we risk a humanitarian disaster.

I did everything I could to refuse, my love. I told them that I had something incredibly important planned, that I needed to be somewhere else. But they insisted, they said I was the most qualified, that without me, the peace talks might not happen at all. I fought, Maria. I fought for us. But this was non-negotiable.

You know how much I love our time together, how I long for every conversation with you. But this mission… it will be intense. Security measures mean I will have limited access to personal devices. My work accounts are monitored, and personal communication is restricted for security reasons.

💔 I need you to be strong for us, my love. These next three weeks will be difficult, but I promise you, they will pass quickly. And when they do… I will come back to you forever, not just for a visit, but for our future.

This is my last mission. My final assignment. When I return, I will no longer be Diego, the diplomat. I will be Diego, the man who belongs only to you.

Will you wait for me, my love? Will you hold onto us, knowing that after this… nothing will ever keep us apart again?

My love, since I told you about this, my heart has felt lighter. I was terrified of how this news would make you feel, terrified of disappointing you. But hearing your understanding, your patience, your love… it means everything to me.

You are my home, Maria. And I promise you, once this mission is over, I will come home to you. Just two more weeks, my love… and then, I am yours forever.

Also, Honey, Willian sent me an email today. He was upset when I told him where I was going, he said that it was dangerous, and that I always put myself at risk. But then he said something that made my heart melt…

“Dad, whatever happens, don’t let my step-grandmother down. Never break her heart.”

Maria… he already sees you as family. He doesn’t question it, he just accepts it, and that means the world to me. Would you like me to give him your email? He asked if he could write to you, maybe for his birthday next week.

Please think about it, my love. You are already so important to him, and to me. You are the heart of this family.

Diego:
Maria, my love… since I told you about this mission, my heart has been heavy. I was afraid of how you’d feel, how this news would hurt you. You know how much I wanted to be with you, how I’ve been counting down the days to finally hold you in my arms.

Diego:
I can’t lie to you, my love… The moment they announced it, I felt something break inside me. I kept thinking, “How will Maria feel? Will she be upset? Will she think I’m choosing this over her?”

Diego:
I want you to know, my Queen… nothing is more important to me than you. You are my heart, my home, my everything. This is not my choice, it was forced on me. But I swear to you, this is the last time. After this, I am done. I will belong only to you, forever.

Diego:
You will wait for me, won’t you, my love? You won’t let this pull us apart? Tell me, my heart… can I count on you?

Honey, something else happened today that made me think of you… Willian sent me an email.

Diego:
At first, he was angry. He was worried about me, saying that this mission was dangerous, that I always put myself at risk. But then, Maria… he said something that made my heart melt.

Diego:
“Dad, whatever happens, don’t let my step-grandmother down. Never break her heart.”

Diego:
Maria… he sees you as part of this family. He doesn’t question it, he doesn’t hesitate. He accepts you completely. Do you know how much that means to me?

Diego:
I didn’t know what to say… but then he asked me something. He asked if he could write to you one day, maybe even for his birthday next week.

Diego:
Would you want that, my love? Would you want to hear from him? I think it would mean the world to him.

Closing with Emotional Reinforcement & Long-Term Visioning

Diego:
Maria, my love… these three weeks will be the hardest I’ve ever faced. But do you know what keeps me strong? You. The thought of coming back to you. The thought of holding you in my arms and never letting go.

Diego:
When I return, Maria, we will never have to wait again. We will build our life together, side by side. And nothing, nothing, will ever separate us again.

Diego:
Say it, my love… tell me you’ll wait for me. Tell me that when I return, I will find you waiting with open arms.

My love, my heart has been so heavy today. 💔 I’ve been struggling to find the right words because I don’t want to cause you any worry. But you are my world, Honey, and you deserve honesty above all else.

This morning, I was called into an emergency delegation meeting. I knew something serious was happening, but I never expected this… The Council overseeing the peacekeeping project in Sudan has made a final decision, I am to be part of the lead delegation team. The situation has escalated dangerously, and if we do not act now, we risk a humanitarian disaster.

I did everything I could to refuse, my love. I told them that I had something incredibly important planned, that I needed to be somewhere else. But they insisted, they said I was the most qualified, that without me, the peace talks might not happen at all. I fought, Honey. I really fought for us😔.. 😩. But this was non-negotiable.

You know how much I love our time together, how I long for every conversation with you. But this mission… it will be intense. Security measures mean I will have limited access to personal devices. My work accounts are monitored, and personal communication is restricted for security reasons.

My Queen, my shinning armor, Will you wait for me, my love? Will you hold onto us, knowing that after this… nothing will ever keep us apart again?

**From User [GF]**
**Just after sending the above message, below my follow up chats;**

Me:
Yes, honey, just for three weeks, and trust me i will always try my best to contact you, Trust me, i do i live without contacting you? how do i live and concentrate on the Job when am not sure your fine or not? so, honey, even me can stay without calling you. But i just wanted you to know, so you don’t get afraid or something when it happens, but i will always try to contact you, my love. And also, there is no war yet, though there had a civil war which is on seize fire, so our mission is hopefully it remains that way, with over 60 thousand dead already, women, children. We are taking a bold step in putting a permanent solution to the situation.
