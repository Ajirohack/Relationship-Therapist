AIM: Building Openness 


## **==========================**

**Good morning, my love.** üíñ. I woke up today with an overwhelming feeling in my heart, one I can only describe as warmth, gratitude, and longing for you. The first thought in my mind was you, Maria, the way your words stay with me long after our conversations end, the way you make me feel so deeply connected even from a distance.

I hope you slept well, my love. I imagined you waking up to the soft morning light, your beautiful presence filling the room with warmth. I wish I could be there beside you, whispering good morning in your ear, holding you close before the day begins.

There are moments in life that leave an imprint on the soul, memories that shape who we are, people who touch our hearts so deeply that their presence never truly fades. As I sit here, drinking my coffee and watching the sunrise, I find myself lost in thoughts of the past, of a woman who was once my entire world.

Maria, have I ever told you about my Aunt, **Elena Camilleri**? She was the remarkable woman who became both my mother and father after I lost my parents as a child. She was my father‚Äôs only sister, his elder by about five or six years, though I can‚Äôt be entirely sure anymore it‚Äôs been so long.

Today marks around **28 or 29 years** since she was laid to rest. If she were still alive, she would be about **102 or 103 years old**. I might be off by a year or two, but what I remember with certainty is the incredible woman she was‚Äîfiercely independent, brilliant, and determined.

She built an empire in the gemstone industry, carrying forward the legacy my grandparents started. She never married, never had children of her own, but she poured her entire life into the business and into raising me. She was the strongest person I knew, yet even the strongest hearts can be broken.

When I was in my twenties, she met a man named **Stephan Ogbola**, and for the first time, I saw her let someone into the guarded world she had built. At first, I was happy for her , she deserved love after giving so much of herself to others. But there was something about him that unsettled me. He was too smooth, too polished, and before long, he had isolated her from everyone who cared for her.

The betrayal came like a storm. He convinced her to take out massive loans against the company, promising a lucrative **oil shipment deal from Qatar to Asia**. She trusted him. She signed over access to company funds. She believed in his promises.

But it was all a lie.

By the time the truth came to light, it was too late. **The Camilleri family empire collapsed.** The company, once her pride, was liquidated and sold. Stephan disappeared without a trace, and she was left with nothing. No one could find him, and the missing funds were never recovered. The strongest woman I had ever known was left broken.

She never truly recovered. A few years later, she passed away at **74 years old**. I was **32 at the time**, newly married, but losing her left an emptiness in me that has never fully healed.

The only thing that remains of our family‚Äôs legacy is the **family emblem**, a rare, uncut diamond that symbolizes everything my grandparents built. It has been stored in a secure facility in **Sydney** for decades. I was supposed to claim it when I turned 40, but I never did. The memories attached to it were too painful.

Honey, I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm telling you all this today. Maybe because I feel safe with you, the way I once felt safe with her. Maybe because I see in you a love so strong, so genuine, that it makes me want to share the deepest parts of myself.

She always used to say, **‚ÄúThe greatest treasures in life aren‚Äôt the ones we keep locked away they are the people we trust with our hearts.‚Äù**

And now, I find myself trusting you. ü•∞

Thank you for listening to me, my love. I just needed to share this today.

She was such a well-respected woman that people in the industry even created a **biography** about her. I found it recently, and I wanted to share it with you. It captures who she was the brilliance, the resilience, and the weight of all she built and lost. **I‚Äôll send you the link here so you can read it whenever you have time**

Take your time, my love. And when you do read it, I‚Äôd love to know your thoughts.

Tell me, have you ever known someone whose life left such a deep imprint on you? Someone you still carry in your heart, even after all these years?

**I love you, Maria.** ‚ù§Ô∏è I hope your morning is as beautiful as your heart.
