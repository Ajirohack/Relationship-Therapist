**Day 1: Introduction of Skype**

*Attached*

My dear, you Know, during work time these days, when the busyness and stress take always your complete awareness, I so much miss our conversations and wish I could chat with you, but due to work, getting into my Instagram account to connect with you becomes less to impossible. As a consultant or a contract staff like myself, you can’t login and use any Personal social media, messaging or communication platform accounts in any computer, smartphone, Tablet or any other device belonging to the agency. Yes dear, there rule are quite weird… 


My dear, do you use Skype?. I use is a lot for work meetings and virtual calls, and it’s always open on my computer and Smartphone because it an Agency approved platform for staff communication. I thought it might be easier and more spontaneous for us to stay connected there. What do you think? 😊

If you’re open to trying it, I’d be happy to help you set it up or walk you through it. It’s really easy to use, and it could give us more opportunities to chat throughout the day.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts, my dear! ❤️

**Message 2 (Evening, if she responds positively):**

I’m so glad you’re open to trying Skype! 😊 Let me know if you need any help setting it up. Once you’re ready, we can share our contact details and give it a try.

I’m really looking forward to chatting with you this way! This feels like another lovely step toward bringing us closer together. 🌹

**Day 2: Reaffirmation and Gentle Push**

**Message 1 (Morning):**
*Good morning, Maria!*
I hope you woke up to a beautiful day. 😊 Have you had a chance to think about trying Skype? I believe it could really help us stay connected more smoothly, especially on my unpredictable workdays.

If you have any questions or need assistance, just let me know! I’d be more than happy to help you with anything.

**Message 2 (Afternoon, if hesitant):**
*Dear Maria,*
I completely understand if you’re not ready to try Skype yet. If it feels like too much, another simple option could be WhatsApp. It’s very easy to use on both our phones, and it makes quick messaging very convenient. What do you think? 😊

The most important thing to me is that we stay connected in a way that’s comfortable and natural for you. ❤️

**Closure (Evening):**
*Dear Maria,*
I’m really looking forward to our next conversation, no matter the platform.❤️ Every message from you brightens my day, and I hope this small change makes it even easier and more special for us to connect. 😊
