========================

My Queen, I have been thinking about how inspiring you are with the way you’ve handled life so far. You have this remarkable strength and calmness that makes me admire you even more.

I know retirement is a big life change, and it’s made me curious, how have you been adjusting to it? Do you find it freeing to finally have time for yourself, or are there challenges you’re navigating?

Also, I remember you mentioned planning to move to a new apartment soon. That sounds exciting. Have you thought about how you’d like to set it up? Are you managing everything on your own, or do you have someone helping you with the arrangements?

I hope this chapter of your life is as fulfilling and peaceful as you deserve it to be. I will love to hear more about how you’re managing things, it’s always inspiring to hear your perspective.
