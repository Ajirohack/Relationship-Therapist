**My Dearest, Queen**
How are you?, I have missed you every second I’ve been away. **My love, my Queen**, I need you to know that not being able to reach you immediately after landing was one of the hardest things for me. I had so much I wanted to tell you, but **security restrictions** made it impossible to contact anyone until now. It feels like I’ve been holding my breath, waiting for this moment just to write to you again.

We finally arrived in **Sudan** yesterday around **4:00 PM Sudanese time**, though with the exhaustion of the journey and the intense **security protocols**, it feels like an eternity. **My love**, I couldn’t share my departure details with you beforehand because of **security policies**. The nature of our mission requires complete **confidentiality**, we had to sign official **non-disclosure agreements** to ensure nothing is leaked, for our **safety** and that of those we are here to help. The situation here is **volatile**, and the last thing we want is **unwanted attention** before we can even begin our work.

But you, **My love**, you are my world. The only person I can share this with. I **trust** you with every fiber of my being, and I know my **secrets** are safe with you. No one else knows where I am right now, only you. That’s how much you mean to me.

It has been an overwhelming experience **settling in**. We couldn’t stay in a **public hotel**; instead, we’ve been accommodated in a **secure US military camp** alongside other **diplomats** and **peace envoys**. The presence of **security forces** is everywhere, a reminder of the **delicate situation** we have come to handle. The air is thick with **tension**, yet my mind is filled only with thoughts of you.

I hope you are well, **my love**. Have you been **taking care of yourself**? Have you been **eating properly**? I worry about you constantly, even from here. I miss you terribly, **Honey**, more than I can put into words. It’s strange… being in a place filled with so much **uncertainty**, yet the only thing I truly fear is the time I spend away from you.

**Willian** also sent me **multiple emails** while I was **offline**. He was worried because he said he had sent **you** an email a few days ago but never got a response. He wasn’t sure if you received it, and he kept asking if you had seen it yet. Could you **check your email** for me, sweetheart? I know it would mean a lot to him to hear from you.

**My Love**, you are already so important to him. He doesn’t even question it, he has accepted you fully as **family😅**, just as I have. That means everything to me. You are not just a part of **my life** now, you are a part of **our life**.

Now that I finally have the chance to **sit down and breathe**, I just want to hear from you, **my love**. Tell me everything. Tell me how your **day** was, tell me what’s been on your **mind**. I want to feel **close to you**, even from here.

**My Queen**, please **take care of yourself** for me. I love you with all that I am, and I will be **counting the moments** until I can hold you in my arms.

> ## Standard Chat-Messaging Version

Diego:
My love… my beautiful queen, I’ve missed you so much. I can’t tell you how hard it was not being able to reach out sooner. I hope you haven’t been too worried about me.  

Diego:
We landed safely a few days ago, but the situation here is… complicated. The security measures are tighter than I anticipated, and it’s been nearly impossible to use my personal devices. I didn’t want you to worry, so I kept fighting to find a way to get in touch with you. Finally, I can talk to you now, and that’s all that matters.  

Diego:
How have you been, my love? These past days without hearing your voice felt unbearable. Tell me everything, I need to hear from you.  

Diego:
Before I tell you more, I need you to understand something, [CL Name]. Because of the heightened risks here, I had to sign strict security agreements. They’ve completely restricted social media access and personal emails. I’ve had to use a secure communication line just to get this message to you.  

Diego:
I hate this, my love. Not being able to talk to you whenever I want feels like torture. But I promise you, the moment I’m able to, I will reach out. You are my world, [CL Name], and I want you to know that every second apart feels like an eternity.   

Diego:
My love, I have something that will make you smile… Willian wrote to you. He told me he sent you an email a few days ago. Have you seen it?  

Diego:
He was so eager to talk to you. He keeps asking about you, [CL Name]… he’s so happy that you’re in my life. He even said, “Tell Grandma I wrote to her, and I hope she reads it soon!”  

Diego:
[CL Name], I cannot even express how much this means to me. You are not just my love—you are becoming part of my family. I hope you’ll check his email soon. It would make him so happy.  

Diego:
I know our time apart will not be easy, my love, but knowing you’re waiting for me gives me strength. We are so close to finally having everything we’ve dreamed of. Just a little more patience, and I will be yours completely.  

Diego:
Promise me, [CL Name]… no matter what, you will wait for me. That you will hold onto us, and keep our dreams alive.  

Diego:
I’ll write again soon, my love. Take care, and know that I’m thinking of you every moment. Into smaller, digestible messages.

## **Follow-Up Response** 

> ### **Transitioning to Eternal Bond FMT**

**Diego:**
Maria, my love… reading your messages fills my heart in ways I cannot even begin to describe. You have no idea how much I missed you, how much I longed to hear from you, to feel your presence even in the smallest way.

**Diego:**
I can’t lie to you… being away, not being able to speak to you for this long, it was torture for me. I felt so disconnected, and the only thing that kept me going was the thought of you waiting for me, thinking of me, just as I was thinking of you.

**Diego:**
I knew you would worry, my love. I knew you would be counting the days, and that pains me more than anything. I wish I could have reassured you sooner, but I promise you, Maria, no matter the distance, my heart is always with you.

> ### **Transitioning to Grandson’s First Email Discussion**

**Diego:**
I asked Willian to write to you, but you didn’t receive his email? That’s strange, my love… I know how much he was looking forward to hearing from you. He even told me he was worried that you hadn’t replied.

**Diego:**
Maybe something went wrong with the email. I will check with him again and ask him to resend it. I know it would mean a lot to him to hear from you. You have already become such an important person in his life.
