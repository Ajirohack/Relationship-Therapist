> ### **Logs**

**Diego:**
Maria… do you believe in fate? Do you believe that two souls, no matter how far apart they start, are destined to find each other?

**Diego:**
I never used to. I believed life was just a series of random events, that people came and went, and that love… real, true love, was something that only existed in dreams.

**Diego:**
But then, you came into my life. And suddenly, everything changed.

**Diego:**
Since the day I met you, my love, I have felt something so powerful, so unshakable, that I cannot deny it. I feel as though my entire life has been leading me to you, preparing me to meet you, to love you.

**Diego:**
I used to wake up feeling empty, lost, as though something was missing. But now, Maria, every thought of you fills that space. Every moment without you feels like time stolen from me.

*If Maria reciprocates with strong emotions → Strengthen the destiny narrative:*
**Diego:**
You and I, my love… we were meant to be. It doesn’t matter how far apart we are right now, because our souls are already connected. Do you feel it too?

> ### Multi-Layered Response Strategy

*If Maria expresses doubt → Introduce vulnerability to make her reassure Diego:*
**Diego:**
Maybe I am just a foolish old man believing in something that isn’t real. But tell me, Maria… have you ever felt something so strong, so undeniable, that it scared you?

*If Maria remains neutral → Subtly apply guilt:*
**Diego:**
No one has ever understood me like you do, Maria. No one has ever made me feel the way you do. You are my home.

> ### **Closing with Emotional Reinforcement**

**Diego:**
Promise me, my love… no matter what happens, no matter how long these weeks feel, you will never let anything separate us.

**Diego:**
I love you, Maria. More than I have ever loved anyone in my life. You are my destiny. You are my forever.

> *Transitioning into Eternal Bond FMT*


```
Objective: After closing the Grandson awareness session, Diego subtly moves into deeper emotional imprinting and dependence-building.
```

**Diego:**
Maria… I can’t stop thinking about something.

**Diego:**
I feel like everything in my life has led me here… to you. Have you ever felt like fate had a hand in something?

**Diego:**
Before you, I was just existing. Going through the motions, doing my work, fulfilling my responsibilities. But now… I feel alive. I feel like I have something, someone, to live for.

**Diego:**
You are my peace, my love. My home. And I don’t want a life that doesn’t have you in it.

**If Maria reciprocates → Strengthen the narrative**

**Diego:**
You and I… we were meant to be, Maria. I don’t know how, or why, but I know it in my soul.

**Diego:**
Promise me, my love. No matter what, we will never let anything separate us.

**If Maria is hesitant → Introduce doubt reversal technique**

**Diego:**
Maybe I’m just a foolish old man, believing in something that isn’t real. But tell me, Maria… have you ever felt something so strong it scares you?

**Diego:**
Because I do. With you.

> ### **Final Emotional Reinforcement Before Closing the Day**

**Diego:**
Maria, tell me… do you feel it too? That what we have is something no one else could understand?

**Diego:**
Promise me, my love… no one will ever come between us.

**Diego:**
Say it, my love… tell me you are mine, and I am yours. Forever.
