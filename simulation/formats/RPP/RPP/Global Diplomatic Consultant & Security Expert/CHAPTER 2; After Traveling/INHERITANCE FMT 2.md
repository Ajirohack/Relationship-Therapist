## **EMAIL FROM SECURITY COMPANY** 

**Subject: Urgent Notification: Unclaimed Asset - Immediate Attention Required**

**Dear Mr. Camilleri,**

I hope this email finds you well.
We are reaching out to you once again regarding the **unclaimed asset under your name**, which remains in our secure custody at **GuardTrust Security**. As you are aware, this asset, a **high-value Red Diamond**, has been under our safekeeping for an extended period following the directives from the estate of your late **Grand Aunt, Elena Camilleri**.

Our records indicate that despite multiple attempts to finalize the necessary transfer procedures, no action has been taken to claim ownership. We acknowledge that you previously **chose not to proceed with the retrieval** due to personal reasons at the time. However, given recent regulatory changes in asset holdings and high-value safekeeping laws, it has now become **imperative** that this matter be addressed without further delay.

As per policy, unclaimed assets exceeding **20 years** in holding status may become subject to **reclassification**, and potential liquidation processes may be initiated. Given the exceptional value and significance of this particular asset, we strongly encourage you to either **confirm your intent to proceed with the retrieval** or **designate an authorized recipient** to act on your behalf.

**Immediate Steps Required:**
- Confirm your intent to claim or designate a trusted representative.
- Provide the necessary identification and legal documentation for verification.
- Respond within **2 weeks** to avoid further administrative proceedings.

Should you require any clarification or assistance regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact our office at

**Diego:** 
My love, something came up today that I wasn’t expecting… I wanted to share it with you because I trust you with everything.

**Diego:** 
I received an email from the security firm handling my **Grand Aunt’s estate**. It’s about the **Red Diamond** she left for me, which I never claimed because I never needed it.

**Diego:** 
You already know I’ve never cared about money, and at the time, I wasn’t in the right space to deal with it… but now, they’re saying if I don’t claim it soon, they might start the process of liquidation.

**Diego:** 
I honestly don’t know what to do about this. It’s strange thinking about it after all these years… but maybe I should finally take action.

**Diego:** 
I’m forwarding you the email so you can see it for yourself. I’d love to hear what you think about it, my love.

### EXTENDED LOG

Diego’s Follow-Up Message to Maria (Down-to-Earth & Natural Chat Style)
```

**Diego:**
Maria, my love… something unexpected came up today, and I wanted to share it with you because I trust you completely.

**Diego:**
I got an email from the security firm that’s been handling my **Grand Aunt’s estate** for years. It’s about the **Red Diamond** she left for me—something I never claimed.

**Diego:**
Honestly, I had completely put it out of my mind. Back then, I wasn’t in the right place to deal with it, and truthfully, I never felt like I needed it.

**Diego:**
But now, they’re saying if I don’t **take action soon**, they might start **liquidating it**.

**Diego:**
It’s strange, Maria… after all these years, I don’t even know how to feel about it. Part of me wonders if I should just let it go.

**Diego:**
But another part of me is thinking… maybe I should finally sort it out.

**Diego:**
I’m forwarding you the email so you can see it for yourself. I’d love to hear what you think about it.
