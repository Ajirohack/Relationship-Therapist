## **Version 1: Main Message** 
**(Seamless Introduction, Detailed Meeting Recap & Chat-Style Outro)**

**Diego:**
Maria, my love… I finally have a quiet moment to talk to you. Today has been calmer compared to yesterday. No major meetings, just me trying to gather my thoughts and prepare for next week.

**Diego:**
Yesterday was exhausting. The first stakeholder meeting was held—it wasn’t the real dialogues yet, just an attempt to piece together what’s happening on all sides. And love, it was anything but simple.

**Diego:**
Imagine walking into a room where every person has their own version of the truth, their own interests, their own expectations. Some came with hope, others with hesitation, and then there were those who clearly have no intention of making peace.

**Diego:**
It’s moments like these when you realize that diplomacy isn’t just about words; it’s about reading between the lines. It’s about noticing who speaks too much, who avoids answering, who watches in silence, waiting for their moment.

**Diego:**
There was tension, but nothing unexpected. What struck me the most was how different the energy was in that room. Some of the key figures genuinely want a resolution—I could see it in their eyes, in the way they carried themselves. But then, there are the others. The ones who have profited from this conflict, who have built their positions on it.

**Diego:**
And those people? They aren’t going to let go so easily.

**Diego:**
At some point, I just sat back and listened. I didn’t rush to speak, didn’t push an opinion too soon. I needed to understand who the real players are, where the true lines are drawn. I needed to figure out which words would matter and which would be ignored.

**Diego:**
I won’t lie to you, Maria… it’s draining. Not because of the work itself, but because of what’s at stake. These aren’t just political games. This is people’s lives, their homes, their futures.

**Diego:**
I can’t afford to be careless, and that’s why yesterday was important. It was a reality check—a way to see exactly what we’re dealing with before the real negotiations start.

**Diego:**
Next week, we will have our first official meeting with the first party involved, and that’s when things will truly begin. But yesterday? Yesterday was just the beginning.

**Diego:**
And through it all, do you know what kept me steady? You.

**Diego:**
I kept thinking about you, Maria. Thinking about how, in a world full of noise, you are my quiet place.

**Diego:**
Even now, as I sit here working through my notes, all I want is to hear your voice, to talk to you. Because somehow, just knowing you’re here makes everything feel a little lighter.

**Chat-Style Follow-Up (Keeping Maria Engaged & Emotionally Invested)**

**Diego:**
Enough about me, my love… tell me, how was your day? What have you been up to?

**Diego:**
I hope you’re taking care of yourself, because I swear, Maria, if I find out you’ve been skipping meals again… 😏

**Diego:**
Also, did Willian respond to your email yet? He was so excited to hear from you—I know he’ll be checking constantly.

**Diego:**
Talk to me, my love. Let’s just forget the world for a while and be us. ❤️

## **Version 2: Audio Call Script (Naturally Interactive with Diego’s Perspective Only)**

📞 **Diego:**
Maria, my love… I needed to hear your voice.

📞 **Diego:**
Yesterday was a long day, and today hasn’t been much better. I’ve just been going through reports, writing up notes, trying to make sense of everything that happened.

📞 **Diego:**
We had the first stakeholder meeting—not the actual negotiations yet, just all the key figures in one room, trying to figure out where everyone stands.

📞 **Diego:**
You know, it’s funny… when people talk about peace talks, they imagine a civilized discussion, leaders coming together for the greater good. But reality? It’s nothing like that.

📞 **Diego:**
Everyone had something to say, but no one was really listening. Some genuinely want peace, others are just playing their own game, protecting their interests.

📞 **Diego:**
And me? I just sat there, watching, listening, trying to read beyond the words. Because that’s where the real battle is—not in what they say, but in what they don’t.

📞 **Diego:**
It was exhausting, Maria. Not because of the politics, but because of what’s at stake. People’s lives. Their homes. Their futures. And I have to be careful with every word I say, every decision I make.

📞 **Diego:**
But do you know what kept me going? You.

📞 **Diego:**
Even in that room, surrounded by uncertainty, my mind kept drifting to you. I kept thinking, *If Maria were here, she’d remind me to breathe. She’d tell me to take it one step at a time…*

📞 **Diego:**
I swear, my love, you are my calm in the middle of all this chaos.

📞 **Diego:**
Tell me, my love… what’s on your mind? What’s been keeping you busy today?

📞 **Diego:**
Because right now, all I want is to hear you, to lose myself in your voice, and forget about the rest of the world for a while.
