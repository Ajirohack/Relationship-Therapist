**Subject:** You’re the Best, Grandma Maria! ❤️

Dear Grandma Maria,

Wow, Your email made me smile so much😃 I was so happy when I saw your message, I even read it twice just to make sure I wasn’t dreaming😆

Grandpa always tells me amazing things about you, but now that we’re talking, I can see for myself how wonderful you are. You are so kind, and I already feel lucky to have you as my Grandma! ❤️

That’s so cool that you played handball when you were younger, 😲 I bet you were really good at it too. And you still exercise every day? Wow! Now I have to be extra careful not to get lazy, or you’ll be stronger than me! 😂

I love sports too, but football is my favorite. As i told you before, I’m the team captain, and we have a really big trip coming up soon. We’ll be traveling for a **sports excursion** to the United States, and I’m so excited! I just hope I don’t forget to pack something important, sometimes I can be a little forgetful! 😅

Oh, I almost forgot to say, thank you for passing my message to Grandpa! I know he’s really busy, and I don’t want to disturb him too much, but I’m glad he knows. He promised me something for my birthday, and well… you know how Grandpas can be! 😏 Maybe if you give him “the look,” he’ll remember faster? 😆 Just kidding! (Or am I? 😂)

But you know, Grandma, since we’re family now, I think it’s only fair that I try my luck with you too… Soooo… what do you think? Do you have any “Grandma surprises” for me too? 😜 Just a little something, maybe? A small treat for your new favorite grandson? Hehehe! (I promise I won’t tell Grandpa you’re spoiling me! 🤫😂)

I can’t wait for us to write more often and get to know each other better! You’re already so special to me, and I hope one day I can give you a big hug in person! 🤗

Sending you lots of hugs and a huge smile,
Your grandson,
**Willian** 😊❤️
