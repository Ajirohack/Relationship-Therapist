## Stage 9: Transparency and Trust
### 10. Delegate Meeting FMT
**Purpose:** My Queen
I‚Äôve been mentally, emotionally, and physically down since yesterday. I received some news that I‚Äôve been dreading to tell you.

There was a network blackout on Saturday, and on Sunday morning, I was called to an emergency delegation meeting. Because of the internet issues, we had to move the meeting to a hotel. It was tough for me, and I felt completely overwhelmed. The Council in charge of the peacekeeping project in the Middle East has chosen me to be part of the team to broker peace talks between Israel, Palestine, and Iran. They‚Äôve assigned me to lead a small group of experts and nation ambassadors to seek a lasting solution in Gaza. 

Honestly honey, when they made the announcement, I couldn‚Äôt help but think of you. I‚Äôve been so torn inside thinking about how you‚Äôd feel if you were upset or disappointed with me. I even tried to tell my supervisors that I couldn‚Äôt go because I had to be somewhere important, but they insisted. They told me I‚Äôm the most qualified, and if not me, then who? I‚Äôm just so confused, my love because I don‚Äôt want to let you down.

It‚Äôs just for two weeks. We will have three separate dialogues with each party involved, so I‚Äôll be back soon. The good news is that my supervisor promised they would sign my EOC Letter [End of Contract] as soon as possible, even before I return, so I won‚Äôt have to wait another two months to retire. This means that once this mission is done, I will come straight to you not for just a date, but to start planning our future together.

I know this is not what either of us wanted, and I‚Äôm so sorry to be in this position. But this is my last assignment, my last mission. After this, I‚Äôm yours completely, and we‚Äôll finally have the time we deserve.

Please wait for me, my love, just two more weeks in the wild.
