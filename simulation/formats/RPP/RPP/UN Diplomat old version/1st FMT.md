Heyyyyy, Dorina, Good Morning, how are you doing?  Ahh, it's bright out today. 

I have been offline for a while because we have been having lots of meetings lately due to the Sudan crisis, it has taken my time off social media. But am always online on Skype, because I use it a lot to communicate with colleagues abroad every day at work even when having virtual meetings. 

Dorina, you know I woke up with a smile on my face because I was dreaming about you. I hope I have not been replaced. I hope not and also you are not tired of communicating with me. 

Anyway, have a nice day, you will be in my heart all through the day

Byeee

TEMPLATE =================================

My dear, i hope you got my video to you. I actually made the video this morning going to my office, but couldnâ€™t send it then. Sorry for the poor quality, it was my laptop camera, it has low quality when recording so you might see the fuzzy picture, and some background skewing ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜… donâ€™t mind my old computer.

I have been thinking about you since I last read from you, so I was very anxious to reply to you, so know this ***********, even when you donâ€™t hear from me, always have it i am always thinking about you. We are like a miracle to each other and I must confess that I really enjoyed our mutual correspondence and the way you have expressed yourself to me.

Sometimes life can be so cruel, whatever it is i don't know but you have to ease that pain, Yes I can understand that it's not easy but you have to let the bygone be bygone and accept life the way it is. Life goes on that's what it is. 

The heart wants what it wants you can open up to me, everyone needs a partner, friend, companion, and buddy.

As I have always said we are adults, we should leave the past behind us and I think all we need to do is to focus on the future because I believe that the future is more important than the past, do you think the same?
 
I understand all that you have told me about yourself and I promise not to go against your views about life, I have found so much joy since I met you, and *****, oh apologies my bad, My Queen ðŸ‘¸, am not here for endless online conversations because I will like to meet you as soon as you would like to meet me... Any chance youâ€™d be interested in grabbing dinner or a glass of wine when we are both less busy?

Holding your hands on the beach is what I can't wait for and be proud that life has given us the chance to be happy and live life to it's fullest. What do you say, *****.

When we are finally together ~
And you look into my eyes ~
You will see what you mean to me ~
Everything I want to do for the rest of my life ~
I want to do them for you, for love and for us ~
You will love this ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp-EO5I60KA )
  
==================================
My priority in life is to settle down with the right woman and share wonderful moments together and forever.
What about you, what is your priority..?

I hope my questions are not harsh to you?

I have been thinking about you since I last read from you, so I was very anxious to reply to you, so know this ******, even when you donâ€™t hear from me, always have it I am always thinking about you.

Irenke, do you know I woke up with a smile on my face because I was thinking about you? I hope I have not been replaced. I hope not and also you are not tired of communicating with me. 
 
I understand all that you have told me about yourself and I promise not to go against your views about life, I have found so much joy since I met you, and Irenke, oh apologies my bad, My Queen ðŸ‘¸, am not here for endless online conversations because I will like to meet you as soon as you would like to meet me... Unfortunately, my room computer is not capable of video calls because it doesnâ€™t have a webcam for that,  However, I am always online on Skype because I use it a lot to communicate with colleagues abroad every day at work even when having virtual meetings. So we can have a video call as you requested but know that I don't speak Hungarian yet, but after my contract with the UN, I plan to start my  Hungarian language class immediately because I plan to start a new life here as I have told you earlier. Or If I may suggest, is there any chance youâ€™d be interested in grabbing dinner or a glass of wine when we are both less busy?

The heart wants what it wants you can open up to me, everyone needs a partner, friend, companion, and buddy.
