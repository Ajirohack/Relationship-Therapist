### Email from Grandchild for SS

We just concluded our Sports excursion presentation training, Dad you know am the captain of the team, so am training hard to win for you, if you find some of the photos in the email. 

Dad, I want to apologize for the way I have been outspoken towards you, during this time. I am sorry because I was selfish that I didnâ€™t think of your feelings, well-being, or health. All I cared about was myself, I pushed you away when you needed me as your only family you have.

A friend of mine lost his Dad yesterday, I felt that I have the most loving Granddad and I still donâ€™t cherish his presence in my life.

I have always wanted you to get married again, but you have kept my request in the dark for years, which also contributed to my anger towards you because I believe that deprived me of motherly love.

Am very happy that you have finally found someone, with the way you always talk about her, it shows you really like GrandAunt ******. Am very happy for you Dad, There must be something in GrandAunt ***** that you choose after all these years. 

If you can let her know, I would like to know my Grandaunt. Does she like kids? Dad. Please tell her I said â€˜hiâ€™, and I would like to meet and know her. 

Dad, also I want to quickly remind you of my Birthday and also the deadline for the Sport Excursion paymentâ€¦ You know I am the Captain of this year's team, I donâ€™t want to miss it. Make the payment as soon as possible.

Talk to you later Dad, I miss you Dad and I love you, Dad.

### After send SS

As I was thinking of what to write to you, I received an email from my Grandson Willian... So I translated the email and screenshot it, so you read it and know how he much loves you, even without meeting you yet

### Acceptance FMT

I wrote you in the middle of the night last night when I couldnâ€™t sleep.  And I do have many questions.  But I want to ask them slowly.  There is no rush. 

I know itâ€™s difficult and unfair to task you with a responsibility as huge as this butâ€¦.

Willian might not be your Son by birth even though we get to be together forever, but he is my only family and I love him so much because he is my only surviving seed. So I will do anything and move mountains for him. 

You know, I first met my late wife in the street of Sydney on my first visit to Australia during my university trips from France, I can say she was the reason I came to live in Australia. She was a lover of nature which I also loved, we literally shared the same hobbies, we were like lost twins. Anyways, we aligned and became friends even when I returned back to France when my holiday was over, we continues being friends and built a solid bond together even with distanceâ€¦ eventually things moved fast and I continued my education in Australia. Everything was going fine for my family, we only had a daughter, Agnes, we started a family together at a very young age, and we grew old together. My Later Daughter, Agnes got married to a Pilot, but unfortunately, died in a plane crash just a few days before their wedding, while being pregnant for Willian, hmmm, he actually grew up without a Dad and a mom. Such sad stories around my family, I donâ€™t know if am cursed or maybe I have a problem I donâ€™t know. I have been a believer and a faithful Christian all my life but I donâ€™t know what I did wrong with the suffering and sadness around me. I am still a strong believer in Christ and I believe there are reasons for everything that has happened and still happening in my life. 

My Queen, I would love to know
*How do you feel about Willian?
*Would you take him and treat him as a Grandchild?
*Would you show love and care for him?
*Can he call you mom? Can he talk to you as a mom?

Please let me know my Queen ðŸ‘¸ 

I will stop here for now, and May the angels protect my queen when she falls asleep. Good night, sweetheart.

**#Ai Updated**

I found myself thinking of you in the middle of the night when sleep wouldnâ€™t come, and there were so many things on my mind. But I want to take my time asking them, with no rush, because theyâ€™re deeply personal to me.

I know itâ€™s unfair to place such a huge responsibility on your shoulders, but I trust you with my heart and everything that matters to me.

Willian may not be your son by birth, but he is my only family, the last connection I have to my late daughter and wife. He is my world. I would move mountains for him, without hesitation. I only want the best for him, as heâ€™s all I have left of the ones Iâ€™ve lost.

I still remember when I first met my late wife on the streets of Sydney, during my university days in Australia. She was everything to me a lover of nature, just like I was. We were two souls that felt like they had known each other forever. Despite the distance when I returned to Italy, we stayed close, and our bond only grew stronger. Eventually, I moved to Australia to continue my studies, and we built a life together. We had one daughter, Agnes, and for a while, life was everything I had dreamed. But then things changed. Agnes married a pilot, Joshua, but tragically, he passed away in a plane crash just days before their wedding, while she was pregnant with Willian. 

Willian has known a life without his parents. It breaks my heart that so much sadness has touched my family. Sometimes I wonder if Iâ€™m cursed or if Iâ€™ve done something wrong to deserve this pain. But through it all, Iâ€™ve held on to my faith, believing that thereâ€™s a reason for all this suffering and loss, even if I donâ€™t yet understand it.

My love, I have a few questions that mean the world to me:
* How do you feel about Willian?
* Could you take him into your heart, treat him as your own grandchild?
* Will you be able to show him the love and care he so deeply deserves?
* Can he look to you as a mother figure? Can he call you 'Mom' and find comfort in you as if you were his own?

I know these are big questions, and I donâ€™t ask them lightly. I just want you to know whatâ€™s weighing on my heart.

Thank you for being the light you are in my life. May the angels watch over you today, my Queen. Good morning, sweetheart
